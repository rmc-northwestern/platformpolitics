aV@PezChicago also, are you planning to share class size data by c/r this year?
p1025
aV@PezChicago @ramsincanon Those are supposed to be maximums and your formula has 30 as midpoint.

aV@PezChicago @ramsincanon It's a simple fact that the formula is set at 30 as midpoint, which works to exaggerate under-utilization.

aV@PezChicago @ramsincanon if you change the formula so the midpoint is 24, how will that change your narrative about under-utlilized scls?

aVPARCC hasn't even proven to public that their test qs are measuring what they set out to measure. Don't buy the hype that you're failing.

p1384
aVand the protests that don't disrupt business as usual, generally have no impact. Can attest to that.
p1385
aVDespite the narrow coverage of tv news, I think it was highly effective. Lots of dialogue btwn protestors/shoppers.
p1386
aVBut I did walk around from store to store, both sides of the street to catch reaction and talk to people.
p1387
aVIn retrospect, disrupting Brooks Brothers shopping - not that impt. I think only 5 people tried to get in.
p1388
aVThat was a remarkable sight. And I hooked arms in front of Brook Brothers after buzzing around for a long time taking things in.
p1389
aVThose tensions are natural and not the end of the world. By 12:30pm or so, ppl were locking arms across stores all down Mich Ave.
p1390
aVWhat was apparent to me about yest, there were tensions among some groups about the message, etc. but ppl worked it out for most part.
p1391
aVWhat I mean, what a stupid q for me not for others asking it. May be impt for them, what do I know.
p1392
aVand during I was thinking, what a stupid q. Who cares. Most ppl were there chanting same messages, 13 months, 16 shots.
p1393
aVIt wasn't organized by one group. I even went in the am asking/tweeting, who is organizing this thing? In end, it didn't matter.

aVGotta go find my fam. So glad I went to that. People may tear it apart for not being x, y, z. I saw a lot of ppl who want a more humane city
p1417
aVI also saw a lot of people in cars at the start of the protest- white and black- honking in solidarity while stuck on Mich Ave.
p1418
aV@gregrgoodman I was like, you're not even aware of your privilege in any way, right? He looked at me like I was nuts. And went into store.
p1419
aV@MisterJayEm I thought he might be a Fox news plant he was so ridiculous, but he wasn't.
p1420
aV@gregrgoodman Ugh! I did not witness much of this. Just one argumentative investment banker who took the day off to be w/ wife to shop!
p1421
aVI saw protestors peacefully telling shoppers, #LaquanMcDonald was 17. He was murdered by a cop. This is for Laquan."
p1422
aVI did see one officer get upset with a protestor early on. Another officer yelled, "move away." they left on bikes.
p1423
aVI saw people disrupting business in a pretty peaceful way and the cops backing off for a long time.
p1424
aVI am guessing that the tv news coverage will look different than what I saw.
p1425
aVThey were planning to shop but said, no big deal, This is great tactic. They didn't know at all what was going on here.
p1426
aVI was standing in front of a store with a family who said they'd never been to protest/rally. Two men from Spain stopped to chat.
p1427
aVThere were a few annoyed folks but very few I saw that showed outrage. Although looks like @gregrgoodman got hit?!
p1428
aVSome elderly white man told me, "I kind of need to return something to ___ but I get this. It's the only way the city will listen."
p1429
aVThis dude tried arguing with protestors (was irate about not being able to shop) but many shoppers I saw were ok. https://t.co/4VQT8sahre

aV@ThisIsShani That makes perfect sense. I am not judging, I'm just saying I haven't lived it.

aV@jgordonwright After sitting through almost every CPS board meeting for 5 yrs, I can tell you I'm comfortable w/ the word callous.
p1542
aV@jgordonwright Sure. Not criticizing his anger. Criticizing his inability to relate to other people not in his world.
p1543
aV@jgordonwright and I was just pointing out his elitism.  And am pretty sure no one protesting knew his dtr was home sick from scl that day.
p1544
aV@jgordonwright he was a disaster for CPS.

aV@jgordonwright what should he have done diff? that would take 3 chapters not 170 chars.

aV@jgordonwright and ignored pleas by parents expressing concerns about safety over and over.
p1547
aV@jgordonwright Oh, maybe didn't express self clearly. Of course I do. My point is he was irate at perceived lack of safety for his kid......
p1548
aVHe was sort of fuming. His kid had to call him at work and she was scared. But so many ps expressing fear for their kid's safety=ignored.
p1549
aVSeemed to be zero self-awareness of fear he was instilling in ppl by enacting policies that put other people's kids in danger. Zero.
p1550

aV@lakecountydem @BeachwoodReport except the non-hispanic white population in Chicago was steady at 31% between 2000 and 2010.

p1600
aVThinking about the students and families at #SaveAmandla this morning. Terrible decision by BOE.
p1601
aV@lakecountydem @BeachwoodReport sorry, stepping off the soapbox now.
p1602
aV@lakecountydem @BeachwoodReport and so we are always dealing with top-down perception of what ppl want rather than any inclusive process.
p1603
aV@lakecountydem @BeachwoodReport + so there are actually many prnts who don't feel the need to sort their kids. But want better resourced HS.
p1604
aV@lakecountydem @BeachwoodReport but hear the complaints all the time. Why is NH HS under-resourced? Why dsn't it offer same courses as SEHS/
p1605
aV@lakecountydem @BeachwoodReport that's an anectotal comment from me, who has a 7th grader in CPS.
p1606
aV@lakecountydem @BeachwoodReport it also helped to weaken NH HSs around city, which is a driver for many fams leaving now. Want strong NH HSs
p1607
aV@lakecountydem @BeachwoodReport so why not just say, choice made some families who could afford to leave, stay, and it ignored majority.
p1608
aV@lakecountydem @BeachwoodReport it also ignores the future economic outcomes of a city when we perpetuate policies that lead to inc ineq.
p1609
aV@lakecountydem @BeachwoodReport understand that. It may help in short-term (while ignoring rest of ed pop and impact to whole system)
p1610
aV@tbfurman I think so but I don't think I can let you read it.  Needs revision!

p1615
aVOr stick them in the Magic Johnson blended learning strip mall, credit for 3 hours of learning place of ed.
p1616
aVand when a system says sorting and ranking and separating is the answer, they can turn backs on those who don't make the cut.
p1617
aVIf the goal of public ed is to separate and sort kids, than maybe that's a true statement. Choice saved the city.
p1618
aVwhen G Chico said "choice saved city" does he mean some fams were able to put a wall around their kids? If so, how does that work 4 whole?
p1619
aVthat's a system that pushes inequality and stratification. May help some, can't help all. Will never help all.
p1620
aVand if the goal is to "get away from" and is embedded in system, how does that work for the whole? and how can that improve the whole?
p1621
aVI think an element of this choice debate not often said is that choice as policy eggs on desire of some ps to sort kids away from other kids

aV@ChiTownCopper apparently G Chico made the comment that students don't mind traveling (up to 4 hours a day total....). Right.

aV@JMOChicago @wttw @alzopp I must have missed that amid another cps crisis. Didn't realize it. An unfunded compact.

aV@JMOChicago @wttw @alzopp also,was pointed out to me that given Gates charter compact, we knew charter fac funding was being increased.
p2984
aV@JMOChicago @wttw @alzopp but I agree, too bad cps didn't update numbers until after vote. Charter number same as prior, tho.
