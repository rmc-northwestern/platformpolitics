aVTrump bringing up #ISIS was a little out of left field, definitely a line he was ready to use but might have used it too soon #debatenight
p1406
aVRT @EsotericCD: The economists are shrieking right now, but Trump forcing Hillary to defend NAFTA is a bad look for her and good for him.

p1408
aVHillary is baiting Trump, and he's biting, but he likes to bite. It's actually his comfort zone #debatenight

aVTrump doesn't look much different than his other debates. Slightly reserved, confident as always. #debatenight

aVHillary looked uncharacteristically nervous in opening statement, tho I doubt that will be remembered by the end. #debatenight

aV@JimTrowbridge Then you're clearly not a good #SJW, because those are their rules
p1421
aVIt's a matter of degree, @JimTrowbridge. And aren't we always told that "intentions" of the offender don't matter as much as the offense?
p1422
aVWhy not, @JimTrowbridge? He'd still be "exercising his freedom of expression" no? #Kaepernick
p1423
aVHere's @ESPN's MO:\u000a\u000aAny1 expressing offense at @Kaepernick7: "Your voice doesn't count."\u000a\u000aAny1 pro- #kaepernick: "Go you! Express away!"

p1425
aVSo not a single 1 of u on @ESPN morning show gets Tony Larussa's viewpoint? That #Kaepernick 's act is EXTREMELY offensive to millions?
p1426
aVRT @samsminiarmy: @koolidge you can be disappointed, just not surprised. ESPN has quite the history of yielding to anything that may even h\u2026
p1427
aVIt's funny how many people think the most pro-American thing you can do is anything literally anti-American. #Kaepernick #NFL #irony
p1428
aVReally disappointed in Chris Berman &amp; Steve Young &amp; @ESPN. Super unbalanced coverage of #Kaepernick 's disrespectful act. Was all "Go 7!"
p1429
aVNo @Kaepernick7, we don't support your actions. And no one should expect respect from such blatant disrespect. #Kaepernick #Booooooo.
p1430
aV@april_ardell Sorry, I'm not taking the bait. As I said earlier... https://t.co/UXOSkEBqVx
p1431
aV@april_ardell and now you're begging the question.
p1432
aV@april_ardell @NFL I'm saying I am extremely offended with the specific way they USED that platform, yes.
p1433
aVIs this what you're looking for? Sorry, thought this was #obvious #NFL #BLM https://t.co/UST8y92Jtw
p1434
aV@april_ardell If they weren't so privileged w/ talent (&amp; fame &amp; $$) they would not HAVE the massive platform for their disrespectful act
p1435
aV@april_ardell Their privilege is ABSOLUTELY relevant to the disrespectful ACT they did. That's been my whole point fr the very beginning.
p1436
aVNow I get it...YOU think I don't like that they're pro #BLM. Never, ever said or even implied that. #mindreading https://t.co/RyQfSEHgmE
p1437
aV@colemanranahan It doesn't offend you (which is fine) but it does offend me (and millions of others). Does our offense count?
p1438
aV@colemanranahan "Expressing yourself" is American. Disrespecting something else (that literally represents America) 2 make a point is not.
p1439
aV@colemanranahan Which makes it (the act of dissing the national anthem to make the point) even more egregious.
p1440
aVTotally get that. But @Kaepernick7 doesn't need 2 dis #USA to do that. Y not speak @ a #BLM rally? Press would go https://t.co/mAav2xzhQH
p1441
aV@april_ardell I'm srsly not understanding what u don't understand. EVERY #NFL athlete is privileged w/talent. No? https://t.co/pGWK0hbCAK
p1442
aV@april_ardell Wow, what an awful thing to say/assume. Make $10 mil/year? Have supreme athletic talent? Watched &amp; adored by millions? Yes plz
p1443
aVIs it not self-evident? Would BILLIONS of people (me included!) not want 2 trade places with ANY of them tomorrow? https://t.co/Vc0BIPtcuk
p1444
aVNot 2 mention everything I said before...extremely "disrespectful" (2 USA, 2 the military, 2 fellow Americans, etc) https://t.co/bL4OOd3ahm
p1445
aV@april_ardell In fact I wouldn't JUST call them "privileged," I'd also add "unappreciative" of their blessings &amp; "ungrateful" of #USA
p1446
aVUr telling me none of these super rich supremely talented indivduals (my word, not "black man") aren't privleged?? https://t.co/1ZUFXeZRhK
p1447
aVThis is where you really lose me April: "Ur issue seems 2B." It's why 99% of race discussions fail. #mindreading https://t.co/1Ev0aSn7Ju
p1448
aVSo it matters now what someone "intended" when they do/say something offensive? Aren't we always told it doesn't? https://t.co/9admWB5tPy
p1449
aVAnd I've already said that I do. Tell me why my offense (and millions of others) doesn't count, again? #NFL https://t.co/wQIqmMfXK7
p1450
aVUr comments have patronizing subtleties. Parent/kid mentality.\U0001f633 Why can't u see how offensive they are? Dig deep. https://t.co/fWqtdPx8KA
p1451
aV@april_ardell OK, I dug deep...I got nuthin.' And ur still entirely missing the point: No matter the cause, disrespect isn't the way 2 go.
p1452
aV(1) Not true. (2) The way #Kaepernick and the rest went about this repels me from their issue. Even if I agreed. https://t.co/CX1WIPzF1h
p1453
aV@april_ardell No. What's upsetting is extremely privileged men thinking it's ok to desecrate something that so many revere, w/o blowback.
p1454
aV@april_ardell I refuse to "have a discussion" about #BLM with such offensive disrespect as the starting point. That's the point.
p1455
aV@april_ardell Don't assume your cause repels me. DO assume disrespectful actions in the name of your cause will repel, not attract.
p1456
aV@april_ardell But I (and millions of others) DO see it as major disrespect. Why doesn't my/our being offended count?
p1457
