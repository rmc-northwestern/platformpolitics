aV@MorningAnswer @PeterRoskam how about we also talk about taxing the corporations their fair share? I play by the rules and pay my share.
p219
aV@PeterRoskam hasn't the president been talking about tuition costs for years now? It's an election year and now the gop cares?
p220
aV@DWStweets  We need more debates on the democratic side. As a democrat, i am dissapointed that you have limited the debates.
p221
aV@PeterRoskam Thats great you stand for life, but planned parenthood does more than just abortions.
p222
aV@PeterRoskam Time to state the facts to the voters that elected you. The Iran deal is a step forward.
p223
aV@PeterRoskam The side deals you think the president is hiding, is actually confidental agreements between the U.N. and Iran.
p224
aV@PeterRoskam won't make out of the senate or past a veto. Wasting taxpayer money as usual.
p225
aV@PeterRoskam @FoxNews @TeamCavuto why don't you go on a real news channel? Afraid of being challenged on your views?
p226
aV@PeterRoskam How is wasting more taxpayer dollars on obamacare help? Provide an alternative! Quit wasting my tax dollars.

aV@larry_kudlow @PeterRoskam Good luck, you'll lose this fight. No more war.

aV@PeterRoskam @TheIranDeal leading democrats aren't true democrats
p230
aV@PeterRoskam i don't see the real reason you oppose the iran deal on your website. Just attacking @POTUS
p231
aV@PeterRoskam @SenSchumer @POTUS thats because he's not a true democrat.
p232
aV@MW_Lovin @PeterRoskam @billclinton @POTUS  yes, not bombing iran. Haven't we seen what 10yrs of war does?  Where will the money come from?
p233
aV@MW_Lovin @PeterRoskam @billclinton @POTUS that doesn't solve anything. The republicans need to stop the pony show and govern.
p234
aV@PeterRoskam @WaysandMeansGOP How about tackling tax reform like Boehner promised in the 2010 elections?
p235
aV@PeterRoskam @billclinton @POTUS im still waiting for your solution then.
p236
aV@PeterRoskam @TheIranDeal  when are going to offer a solution, instead of tweeting talking points. Be part of the solution, not the problem.
p237
aV@PeterRoskam @TheIranDeal  So, what do you tell our allies that are in full support of this deal?
p238
aV@PeterRoskam and i plan not to vote for you in your next election.
p239
aV@PeterRoskam like i said, the current process isn't working. Have you actually read the whole agreement?
