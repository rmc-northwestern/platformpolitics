aV@dansenor honest question: if you were a dem advisor, how would you advise them in light of GOP obstruction re Garland and why?
p1469
aV@LindseyGrahamSC as was Merrick Garland before him...
p1470
aV@matthewjdowd Also it's inevitable that there will be consequences to GOPs obstruction. Are Dems to be expected to pretend it didn't happen?
p1471
aV@matthewjdowd Argument is that Dems don't believe they had adequate time to question/things have arisen requiring follow up (e.g. HHS, Edu)
p1472

p1488
aV@BootsFactor @SpeakerRyan Now? I question if he knows who he is anymore. His cowardice dominates the man he is. Perhaps who he ever was
p1489
aV@BootsFactor @SpeakerRyan agreed. 4 years when his name came up I said, he's a guy I disagree w/on principle but his hearts in right place
p1490
aV@DavidHaugh Gar/Pax getting canned at end of year will be more telling.  And very welcome by the fan base.

aV@matthewjdowd true and he played a role but his opposition didn't meet him on the road either. They dug in w shields up from moment one.

aV@ron_fournier totally but shouldn't PEOTUS and GOP face it that they won with 2M+ less votes as well? They behave like they dominated
p1554

p2416
aV@davenathan wait until you hit your 40s and new tests begin #realproblems
p2417
aV@thekapman what do you think the outcome is for us? Gasol+mirotic+?
p2418
aV@WojYahooNBA what about boooooooozer?
p2419
aV@KCJHoop do you think acquiring he and Randolph impacted melo outcome? Their absence would've cleared more room...
p2420
aV@ESPNSteinLine been dispelled many times actually. Product of other teams negative campaigns. Check w local guys. He's gone no matter what
p2421
aV@FisolaNYDN @JonHeymanCBS yawn
p2422
aV@McGrawDHBulls or perhaps looking at dwindling 2015 options. Lamarcus out. Love likely to cavs. Who's Phil going to get?
p2423
aV@McGrawDHBulls gut says?
p2424
aV@JaredZwerling any news updates on Melo? What do bulls do if he passes?
p2425
aV@jon_greenberg Plus DRose won't recruit him...because we all need to be recruited some days.

aV@KCJHoop what's likely next for us? Wouldn't Monroe be worth a shot? Morrow?
p2438
aV@NickFriedell Love, Gasol or Parsons + Mirotic
p2439
aV@AschNBA @JJacksonSPT No reason 4 Bulls to commit that sort of $ to Lu.  Solid player but skills dont complement team needs. Duplicative
p2440
aV@united why do your open economy plus seats always go to standby passengers or stay vacant unless someone pays upgrade fee? Odd policy
p2441
aV@thekapman neither?
p2442
aV@NickFriedell he's also really classy. Check out where else he like to spend his money...
p2443
aV@swirsk054 these reporters should be narrowing their list of "sources". Giving journalistic integrity a bad name...
p2444
aV@ramonashelburne doesn't work that way. Don't they need to resign him first or rescind cap hold to sign melo in first place?
p2445
aV@swirsk054 @Addison_Russell
p2446
aV@jon_greenberg take it back! He should only be dealt for hard hats or copper piping!

aV@FisolaNYDN that he wants to win and it's most important?
p2448
aV@KCJHoop @Chris_Broussard or that other teams leaking negative press and using his "sources" as a means to end
p2449
aV@jon_greenberg maybe some truth but @Chris_Broussard wld use the walls in a bathroom as "sources". He isn't exactly the bastion of reporting
p2450
aV@jimcallisMLB only way he was going to forego vandy...

aV@ESPNSteinLine @ZachLowe_NBA but what does Indy actually have to trade?
p2458
aV@ESPNSteinLine thats a silly tweet. What else can they do but have backup plan ready? Would be malpractice to sit idle
p2459
aV@Chris_Broussard didn't Cleveland say same thing?  Posturing happens all the time. You are just a pawn for them in this process

aV@drose dude we get that you are proud and support all teammates, but have some sense man. Don't sabotage your team's own pursuits in process

p2479
aV@McGrawDHBulls So was Omer Asik once upon a time...you hearing about any particular moves or is Berto a vault as per usual?
p2480
aV@McGrawDHBulls Seems like a no-brainer, no?  Unless a top shooter falls.  What about the 7'3 guy?
p2481
aV@ron_fournier not about evils as much as stagnation. They do absolutely nothing. I feel like they just have Issa hearings
p2482
aV@KCJHoop Or the Bagel...
p2483
aV@HowardBeck Why would Wade opt out when he's worth $8M per at this point?
p2484
aV@NickFriedell red brown or blue line?
p2485
aV@McGrawDHBulls @Singal3 what if the picks are next year/future (ie sac pick and ours) or butler or snell involved or some combo?
p2486
aV@swirsk054 @WojYahooNBA being the exception
p2487
aV@BillSimmons absurd to think it costs mirotic to unload mike d and tony from the all wire squad. Mike would be easy to unload
p2488
aV@KCJHoop any sense that they've learned from past? Is Derrick more active?
p2489
aV@jimcallisMLB @jaketoobies @Cubs @MLBDraft how much $ left in pot?

p2498
aV@McGrawDHBulls why would wade turn down player option? Whos payin $20m?
p2499
aV@ChrisMannixSI why not add a franchise tag concept?
p2500
aV@realDonaldTrump @jon_greenberg You are quite magnanimous, gracious and humble.  Please never change
p2501
aV@samsteinhp @jbendery logical conclusion one would come to. How'd he get from a to zzz?
p2502
aV@ron_fournier maybe they just thought he was a pompous ass? Came off that way to most observers who didn't really know him or his platform
