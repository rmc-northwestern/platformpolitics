aV@jogblog @Helsieboo No-one could describe training and running for a Marathon as fun.It's hard,painful, and often miserable
p2256
aV@jogblog @Helsieboo A tiny % wear Fancy dress. Most of them also run.
p2257
aV@jogblog @Helsieboo There are approx 13k Golden Bond places each raising minimum £1.5 Of the total field about 75% are running for charity.
p2258
aV@jogblog @Helsieboo Why would you say that Golden Bond runners don't run it. I think if you checked most of them do.
p2259
aV@jogblog @Helsieboo Nonsense.
p2260
aV@jogblog @Helsieboo They're not mutually exclusive.
p2261
aV@jogblog @Helsieboo Yes I did so I won and so did the charity.I wouldn't make all that effort without doing it for someone other than me.
p2262
aV@jogblog @Helsieboo Lots of people knew the person I was running for. They couldn't do it themselves and they wanted to support me.
p2263
aV@jogblog @Helsieboo I took the place with that intention. But friends and family actually WANTED to sponsor me.
p2264
aV@jogblog @Helsieboo Not at all.  You don't have to take a bond place. You do it because you WANT to raise the money.
p2265
aV@jogblog @Helsieboo Why?
p2266
aV@Helsieboo @jogblog I HAD to raise £1.5k last year. I got £2.3k. Knowing how much people had invested in me made me work really hard.
p2267
aV@Helsieboo @jogblog Charity places require you to raise a certain amount of money. I think most people train hard to not let sponsors down.
