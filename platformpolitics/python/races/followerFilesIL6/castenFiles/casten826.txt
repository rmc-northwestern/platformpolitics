aV@BOffTV @ScandicAtheist @TheoryFail @buffsblg @StuartHelmer So you just contradicted that picture.
p2883
aV@RichyWilson @CourtneyChatz @BOffTV @TheoryFail It's not confirmed. Leading evolutionists even admit there's no evidence.
p2884
aV@ScandicAtheist @TheoryFail @buffsblg @StuartHelmer @BOffTV The Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered in 1947 and were 2,000 years old.

p2890
aV@RichyWilson @CourtneyChatz @BOffTV I'm not denying evidence. I've yet to see any. At least none that haven't been disproved already.
p2891
aV@TheoryFail @buffsblg @StuartHelmer @BOffTV @ScandicAtheist NIV and the others are. But the King James Version is the only correct version.
p2892
aV@CourtneyChatz @RichyWilson @BOffTV Plenty of evidence? Where is it?
p2893
aV@buffsblg @StuartHelmer @TheoryFail @BOffTV @ScandicAtheist I wasn't a Christian until a few years ago. So that argument is invalid.
p2894
aV@buffsblg @StuartHelmer @TheoryFail @BOffTV @ScandicAtheist I go by what the Bible says, not some man-made doctrine.
p2895
aV@CourtneyChatz @RichyWilson @BOffTV Most of the "evidence" has been disproved.
p2896
aV@CourtneyChatz @RichyWilson @BOffTV I like science, but only real science. With evidence and such. Evolution has zero evidence.
p2897
aV@StuartHelmer @buffsblg @TheoryFail @BOffTV @ScandicAtheist @erichovind Church of England was created by Henry VIII so he could divorce.

aV@stafferoinen @TheoryFail @ScandicAtheist @erichovind I had Christian friends go there who were criticized for their beliefs by professors.
p2899
aV@stafferoinen @TheoryFail @ScandicAtheist @BOffTV @erichovind And I facepalm'd when I was sent to Berkeley's site, a known atheistic school.
p2900
aV@buffsblg @TheoryFail @BOffTV @ScandicAtheist @erichovind Those who follow the Bible without adding to or changing it. Catholic Church did.
p2901
aV@buffsblg @TheoryFail @BOffTV @ScandicAtheist @erichovind Yeah, but Catholicism is a false religion
p2902
aV@sunechobiz @BOffTV @TheoryFail @erichovind Those sites say the same thing as every other site. I've been searching for evidence for years.
p2903
aV@tattoosandbones @TheoryFail @steapot @BOffTV My point exactly.
p2904
aV@HenryKraft5 @erichovind Oh, so you're one of those who believe a fetus is really a fish. That was disproved in the 1880s, by the way.
p2905
aV@BOffTV @sunechobiz @TheoryFail @erichovind That wasn't proof. That was saying there is proof, but didn't give any.
p2906
aV@dzeieio @BOffTV @ScandicAtheist @erichovind Congratulations...?
p2907
aV@BOffTV @ScandicAtheist @erichovind I have no problem with science. I'm just against lies being passed as science.

p2909
aV@tattoosandbones @TheoryFail @steapot @BOffTV I'm guessing you think the geologic time scale exists anywhere except textbooks.
p2910
aV@BOffTV @ScandicAtheist @erichovind I don't know a Christian evolutionist.
p2911
aV@RichyWilson @BOffTV @erichovind Immunity to drugs isn't evidence of evolution.
p2912
aV@sunechobiz @TheoryFail @BOffTV @erichovind I skimmed them. Those sites say the same thing every other site says. No real proof.
p2913
aV@BOffTV @ScandicAtheist @erichovind lol Some of the sites people have shared with me are atheist blogs. How is that less biased?

p2915
aV@steapot @TheoryFail @BOffTV @erichovind This isn't evidence. Fossils can't tell you anything. They don't talk. http://t.co/2WNGGDVFvj
p2916
aV@sunechobiz @BOffTV @erichovind No, I've searched before I was a Christian. All I ever see is "We have evidence" but they never provide any.
p2917
aV@ArgRipper @BOffTV @erichovind I didn't find Hovind until last year.
p2918
aV@TheoryFail @BOffTV @erichovind ...that says nothing other than "there's evidence, we have evidence, this is fact because we have evidence".
p2919
aV@BOffTV @erichovind Evolution is the exact opposite of Christianity. If evolution is real, the Bible is wrong. Which I know it isn't.
p2920
aV@BOffTV @erichovind Where's the evidence? I've searched for years and have yet to see even a single shred of evidence of evolution.
p2921
aV@BOffTV @erichovind Evolution. It's a religion.
