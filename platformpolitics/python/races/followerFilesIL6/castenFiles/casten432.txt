p2102
aV@BernieSanders US gov't needs to take a better look at how all of this interconnects rather than try to deal with each issue independently.
p2103
aV@BernieSanders It even satisfies the business owners who may not be prepared to meet such a huge leap in wages and so may save many US jobs.
p2104
aV@BernieSanders That way, everyone is happy and the overall cost of living Ian't too affected.
p2105
aV@BernieSanders I think a living wage for adults without kids would be best paired with proper daycare and related expense coverage for kids.
p2106
aV@BernieSanders People without kids are not far from a living wage, but people with kids, the kids themselves, need serious help.
p2107
aV@BernieSanders We need a better approach to finding a solution. Focus on childcare, you'll knock out a big part of the wage issue.
p2108
aV@BernieSanders But fixing the symptoms is more expensive than dealing directly with the cause.
p2109
aV@BernieSanders ...which is exacerbated by lack of relational/family education in schools and later. Free classes would help, as would NHS.
p2110
aV@BernieSanders In other words, lower quality care for the kids. The family dynamic starts to break down due to increased stress...
p2111
aV@BernieSanders Having no breaks between work and kids leads to lack of self-care which leads to physical and psychological health issues.
p2112
aV@BernieSanders The dilemma trickles down when a parent is forced to stay home with his/her kids beyond 10-12hrs, every day of every year.
p2113
aV@BernieSanders It's a ridiculous situation to be in, especially for the kids it affects. They are the most in need of high-quality daycare.
p2114
aV@BernieSanders Yet, if the benefits were any less, they wouldn't be able to afford to work at all.
p2115
aV@BernieSanders Many people report having turned down jobs that pay more because the benefits they'd lose are worth more than the increase.
p2116
aV@BernieSanders This is why so many parents are forced to stay on assistance. There is a huge gap between the cut-off point and independence.
p2117
aV@BernieSanders And in order to get 100% benefits, you essentially have to make less than what you need to make up the difference/remainder.
p2118
aV@BernieSanders Where I live, 100% daycare assistance benefits only covers the first $2.50/hr after age 2.5yrs.
p2119
aV@BernieSanders FT workers need an average of $5.61/hr PER KID just to go to work... That's before they can make any money for rent/life/etc.
p2120
aV@BernieSanders The avg cost of daycare centers in the US is $11,666/yr (or $972/mo), but prices range from $3,582-18,773/yr. That's PER KID!

p2526
aV@PaveDarker @mmpadellan Just using this basic understanding, if you read scripture, starting with the Bible, you'll discover its message.
p2527
aV@PaveDarker @mmpadellan Also, in scripture, "men" were the children of GOD (regardless of gender). "Women" were communities of such "men".
p2528
aV@PaveDarker @mmpadellan With allegorical interpretation as used in the New Testament, animals represented foreign spiritual people, pagans.
p2529
aV@PaveDarker @mmpadellan The religious laws beyond scripture were made and interpreted by a population that was growing towards literalism.
p2530
aV@PaveDarker @mmpadellan The New Test. gives examples. Try studying Genesis chapters 1&amp;2 in that light and learn what everything represents.
p2531
aV@PaveDarker @mmpadellan It might interest you to know that originally, scripture was primarily interpreted as allegory, using symbolism.

p2557
aV@TheSun Personally, I'm sick of the shallow, literal interpretations of scripture that have given rise to what is recognized as "religion".
p2558
aV@TheSun Religion seeks to control the forces of the world from the inside-out. Politics seeks to control from the outside-in.
p2559
aV@TheSun Regardless of your religion, belief and politics are in reality two sides of the same coin. Religion is just a framework for belief.
p2560
aV@TheSun Thus, we're all conversing with GOD, but the best responses are believed to come from those who perceive and respect that reality.
p2561
aV@TheSun One worldview is that every situation is presented by GOD and that we respond to GOD whenever we decide or act. It's a conversation.
p2562
aV@TheSun Every decision and subsequent action is guided by belief; every person is guided by a set of beliefs that we might call a worldview.
p2563
aV@TheSun Religion &amp; politics are 2 sides of the same coin. It's foolish to dismiss either one in any individual, esp. a priest or politician.
