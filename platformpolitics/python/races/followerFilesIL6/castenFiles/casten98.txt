aV@btcare Hi Diarmuid could you call again now plz? Unfortunately when you called earlier I was on the phone with a customer services manager
p2728
aV@BTCare Sigh, looks like my intermittent problem is still there though, my connection just dropped and came back again

p2811
aV.@btcare 3) So, 10 days after reporting, 12 days after pro started, still none of my multicast channels are working\u000a\u000aWhat would you do?
p2812
aV.@btcare 2) Support call on Wed night, guy said I should hear from support within 1 hour or BT Wholesale within 48 hours. I have not
p2813
aV.@btcare 1) You said you would call Thu to find out how the engineer visit had gone on Wed - you did not
p2814
aV@kerryb You need to be more ruthless :-)

p2826
aVBT call to ask if the problem was fixed. Wha? Guy then asks me to confirm my Vision box is directly connected to home hub. Aaaaaa!!!
p2827
aV@davidjames congratulations!
p2828
aV@davidjames right on
p2829
aV@psd Damn it's ugly though. &lt;blink&gt; tags would fit right in

aV@jamesbroadhead @psd Yep but not in the Mac desktop Twitter app; &amp; I still don't see the *actual* URL anywhere, which is what I'd like
p2831
aV@jamiebullock I like that one! Mine is more accidental, I forget where I left my car keys so I have to cycle to the shops with my backpack
p2832
aVBT Vision fault passed to another technical team; I'll hear "within 48 hours". As I thought, definitely not a home equipment problem
p2833
aVEngineer calls technical help line. They tell him to try a YouView box. Hmmm.
p2834
aVNew BT Vision box; same old BT Vision problem
p2835
aVDear @LinkedIn it is *creepy* when I log in, browse around some profiles, and 2 minutes later get a targeted sales email from you.
p2836
aVEngineer says everything has checked out fine so he reckons it's the BT Vision box and is fetching a new one.
p2837
aV@kerryb @shezza_t You're committing a thought crime anyway Kerry
p2838
aVBT Vision engineer is here. I dare to hope he can identify the problem. (Feels to me like it's a multicast problem somewhere)
p2839
aV@psd Boo!!! indeed
p2840
aV@psd Yeah, I wish Twitter would at least show the real URL when hovering over a shortened one - or have the Twitter clients un-shorten it

aV@BTCare Told last night fault had been escalated to network support. Didn't hear back today so looked online to see fault marked 'Cleared'
