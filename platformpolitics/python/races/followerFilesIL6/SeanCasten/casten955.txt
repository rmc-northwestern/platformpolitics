aV@TheDaleJackson @AndyKing191 I don't know any priests or preachers advocating violence against gays. Anyways, back to the point...
p3198
aV@TheDaleJackson right. The cause is a perversion of faith. Just as the inquisition and the crusades were perversions of christianity.
p3199
aV@TheDaleJackson point taken. But we should separate the religion from its most extreme and violent followers. That's the point.
p3200
aV@TheDaleJackson @WVNN plenty of people. Particularly, those who think hijacking religion in order to kill and oppress is specific to Islam.
p3201
aV@TheDaleJackson @WVNN what is the criticism here? I'm confused as to why this point about our own history bothers the right.
p3202
aV@WVNN @TheDaleJackson POTUS is correct. Christendom has gone thru terrible times when religion was used to inflict atrocities on the world.
