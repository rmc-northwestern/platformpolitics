aV@JakeSherman @JohnJHarwood Also there is no such thing as "filibustering" in the house

p1025
aV@neeratanden @ForecasterEnten agreed but not ultimately relevant to the critique of his op-ed
p1026
aV@ForecasterEnten I agree, but that misses the point on Russia, ethics, corruption, etc.

p1030
aV@NoahCRothman I don\u2019t expect him to vote for liberal policy, but has he introduced or sponsored any leg to back up his concern?

aV@jpodhoretz SCOTUS has the power of judicial review. If a prosecutor brings charges despite a pardon then it would be a live controversy.
p1103
aV@mattyglesias Its unfortunate that we went through that whole Nixon thing without any amendment to the pardon power
p1104
aV@jpodhoretz The next president/DOJ can bring criminal charges and the question could get litigated by SCOTUS
