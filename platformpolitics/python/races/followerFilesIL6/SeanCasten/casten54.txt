p1606
aV@TwisterT3 it's "pro-gay, pro-choice, liberal" etc. At least according to Ted Cruz.
p1607
aV@TwisterT3 oh, absolutely, but Cruz just launched into a thing about how terrible "NYC values" are, which was odd in an unexpected way!

aV.@WheatonCollege STILL cannot articulate what tenant of the SoF she violated. It seems so clearly reactionary. #reinstatedochawk
p1678
aVIt seems clear that Dr. Hawkins has consistently been targeted for things that have ultimately been found to NOT violate the SoF.
p1679
aV3. She suggests curriculum should have "diplomatic vocabulary for conversations around sexuality." Umm. What could even be wrong with that?
p1680
aV2. She was seen at a house party that MAY HAVE BEEN a Pride party. The fact that this would require reaffirming the SoF is beyond upsetting.
p1681
aV1. Her black liberation theology "seemed to endorse a kind of Marxism." Why would that violate the SoF? Clearly, in the end, it didn't.
