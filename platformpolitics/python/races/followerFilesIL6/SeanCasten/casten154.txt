aVI am with @Keev26 on ArrestedDev. Bounced off it after a few episodes on first run.  Got back into later.Still haven't finished. @achester99
p1942
aV@Keev26 @achester99 Good job with the TV lists on #32fans, but it may be the first time that I have been confused for a guy in his 50s. ;)

p1948
aV@achester99 @Keev26  My list of cities is not as broad (GB, Chi, Mad, MSP). Vikings fans too obsessed with lack of Super Bowl.
p1949
aV@achester99 @Keev26 There are advantages to living away from your teams. You miss the bad behavior of your fellow fans.
p1950
aV@achester99 @Keev26  I remember making fun of Viking fans about the blackouts. Ribbing Vikings fans is one of the perks of living in MN.
p1951
aV@achester99 @Keev26 New to MN in 1997.  Seemed very whiny.  I had lived with teams that had been bad for a while. Used to whiny MN fans now.
p1952
aV@achester99 @Keev26 Strib says 4 blackouts - https://t.co/oBtIIwnJ5v - surprisingly hard info to find. I know Vikings fans had reasons.
p1953
aV@achester99 Viking fans not so great. 4 (?) TV blackouts in 1997 for a team that won a game in the playoffs. @Keev26 #32fans

aVRT @PattyMurray: Wishing a very happy wedding anniversary to two amazing people -- John and\u000aAnnie Glenn celebrate 73 years today! -PM \U0001f680

aV@achester99 @robcesternino @Keev26 Indeed, good arguments and a record number of times that you threatened to cut something out, but did not
p1956
aV@robcesternino @Keev26 @achester99 Nice episode on #32fans.  A little too much baseball talk for my tastes, but the arguments were top-notch
p1957
aV@achester99 @Keev26 Me as well though most of my family argues for an exception for Umich. Plus Maryland still doesn't seem right.
p1958
aV@achester99 @Keev26 I get your perspective on Zuckerberg. Front row in the FBI explosion.  Personal email from a Winkelvos. Fun stuff #GLA
p1959
aV@achester99 @Keev26 Tough episode.  Beat up on my Badgers and Gates won. Somewhere Paul Allen and Bronson Koenig are shaking their heads.
p1960
aV@Keev26 @achester99 Zuckerberg had good marketing people. Lucky MySpace tanked. Sean Fanning was similar, but his tech was more original.
p1961
aV@Keev26 @achester99 Gates was mediocre as a programmer, little better as a manager. He hired good people. Buffet is a better philanthropist.
p1962
aV@Keev26 @achester99 I am a tech geek, that's why I think Gates and Zuckerberg are overrated. Both copied tech, and leaned on connections.
p1963
aV#middletennesseestate just destroyed my bracket.  Congrats to them! #MSU #NCAATOURNAMENT
p1964
aV@achester99 @Keev26 1984 was the first campaign I paid attention to. Glenn ran a bad primary, but would have a better chance than Mondale.
p1965
aV@achester99 @Keev26 Ha! Probably was the right spot for Glenn.  Now if Gates or Zuckerberg make it much further, that will be a travesty.
p1966
aV@achester99 @Keev26 Fair enough. Love Glenn - wish he would have been President. Only got 3 yrs toward engr degree - got hon BS after orbit
p1967
aV@achester99 @Keev26 Gates, Zuckerberg, and Harvard: all #overrated .  Also, John Glenn not a scientist. #32fans
p1968
aV@Keev26 @achester99 Love the Greatest Living American bracket. Vint Cerf &amp; Don Knuth not famous enough? Bruce Springsteen could have made 68
p1969
aV@sctimestom Good article on Braham/Albany, but it was tight.  Albany led by at least 5, and was probably up more in last quarter.
p1970
aVRT @scalzi: Aaron Burr raises his hand.  https://t.co/15d1gdGWT3

p1972
aV@Keev26 Feynman and Sagan would have been great picks, but alas they're on the alternate side.
p1973
aV@Keev26 Lederman has Nobel prize in physics, plus work on science education, and science adminstration.
p1974
aV@Keev26 Steve Wozniak and Elon Musk are good matchups for Gates. Leon Lederman and Frank Wilczek  not famous enough? Neal deGrasse Tyson?
p1975
aV@achester99 @Keev26 #TheMartian science is pretty good. The starting storm is not realistic (matches book), the ending is juiced for movie.
p1976
aV@DougFeinberg Not surprising that the team that wins the 3rd game of the #WNBAFinals wins series 70%. If teams equal should happen 68.75%

aV@robcesternino Love the #WalkingDead recaps.  I'm worried about the food situation in Alexandria.  Will we see the return of Farmer Rick?
p1984
aV@acmazzaro Loved the recap of Parks&amp;Rec. Didn't like the last one as much as you two. Can't beat the last Johnnie Karate. #candicebergen.
