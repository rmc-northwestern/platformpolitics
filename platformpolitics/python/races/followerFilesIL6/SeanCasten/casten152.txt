p1318
aV@lizzykremer - not at all! I'm just saying it HELPS. If an agent sells the rights it doesn't help at all.
p1319
aV@lizzykremer Not at all. I am saying if we sell rights globally, it aids the UK. If the agent sells them, it does nothing for our UK sales.
p1320
aV@lizzykremer: it definitely isn't always true, but we find if we don't sell the rights it will almost NEVER help the UK book.
p1321
aV@lizzykremer: Agents rarely inform us about foreign deals. When we handle rights, UK sales informs accounts. Our deals then aid UK sales.
p1322
aV@lizzykremer: when agents sell foreign deals it is not conjoined w/the UK publication. If publishers sell rights, one hand feeds the other.
p1323
aV@lizzykremer: Disagreed! Publishers edit/market/design a book. This work helps foreign publishers succeed. Each foreign deal aids UK sales.
