aV@ClubhouseCancer as someone who's temper occasionally rears it's ugly head...I get it.
p2624
aV@ClubhouseCancer set expectations too high.  He's a good to very good player...not a savior
p2625
aV@ClubhouseCancer Castro came up too early and was cast as the franchise savior from Day 1.  His debut didn't help him either.
p2626
aV@ClubhouseCancer it might take a while and several teams to do just that.
p2627
aV@ClubhouseCancer u might be right. He might need to get out of the spotlight of Chi and get head back together.
p2628
aV@ClubhouseCancer seems like it.  I really like him &amp; think he will snap back, but it might have to be somewhere else.

aV@bleedcubbieblue thats 1 question answered..now what number is Hyde changing to?
p2926
aV@JulieDiCaro actually, I see him going 0-4 with 3 k's.  Too much pressure today.  Let hype calm down then he'll hit them
p2927
aVSo...when does the press release from the players union talking how its a dark day because Russell isn't called up yet come out

aV@cowsarecool220 @WrigleyRenovate @ChicagoNow What National exposure.  Cub games on WGN are not shown nationally anymore.  (more)
p2949
aV@CubsNoHitStreak no no a thousand times no. Stop holding the town drunk in such high esteem. Just let crowd sing. No one "leads" them.
p2950
aV@WrigleyRenovate @ChicagoNow never was a fan of Harry's and certainly don't feel they should put his image up every day
p2951
aV@WrigleyRenovate @ChicagoNow Cubs should get rid of guest singer and just have crowd sing. No need to put video of town drunk on jumbotron

p3000
aV@cubs_scott When this was announced, I asked the question at the convention and thats the reasons they told me.
p3001
aV@cubs_scott nope.  They wanted them off the field to prevent players from tripping over the mounds and running into pitchers in bullpen
p3002
aV@cubs_scott mlb &amp; the players union asked them to take them off the field for safety reasons
p3003
aV@ClubhouseCancer @Cubs some of them last year looked is really poor shape.  Being taken up once again, stored and moved sure wont help those
p3004
aV@ClubhouseCancer @Cubs at least that way they won't have to explain the bricks that have gotten broken during the many moves...
p3005
aV@ClubhouseCancer @Cubs I'm sure they have "impeccable"  records #yeahsure
