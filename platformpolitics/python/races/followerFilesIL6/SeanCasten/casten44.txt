aV@jamfan40 Hah I was gonna say. Jake/Lester went 7.2 IP with 1 run allowed.
p2995
aV@spshoot Yes but if you are talking about all time historical performances, he gave up some hard hit balls early. Got more dominant later on
p2996
aV@spshoot It was really good but he also got lucky. Russell's drive to the track is a HR in roughly 95% of games at Wrigley

aV@jareddiamond @WSDreaming_Cubs @BleacherNation But where do you get that the Diamondbacks have shown they are better then the Cubs?
p3137
aV@BleacherNation @WSDreaming_Cubs @jareddiamond Plus the Cubs are only 2 GB and -24 in RD.  Could easily tie or pass\u2026 https://t.co/TptyUuA1IA
p3138
aV@SInow And they did the fake interviews after a HR 1st.  What a team!
p3139
aV@BradBiggs no point to Glennon. If Mitch sucks because of receivers oh well he gets actual reps. Watch mike g from bench helps nothing
p3140
aV@gfs918 @Rich_Campbell @BradBiggs D wasn't great but I mean Packers were +4 on turnovers and one of the TDs was on\u2026 https://t.co/nH6Xg2wJNR
p3141
aV@Cubs 13-3? Something your pigskin brethren could only dream of
p3142
aV@krechenmacher Notice I didn't say I LIKE Pace either. But he's done better at getting more talent in the draft than his predecessors
p3143
aV@Cubs @RandallJSanders No pressure Randall!
p3144
aV@krechenmacher I don't dislike Pace but the rest yeah
p3145
aV@CEmma670 Bye bye Fox
p3146
aV@JasonLaCanfora He is basically staking his job to this garbage QB
p3147
aV@Michael_Cerami I think they drew for the Wild Card game and World Series in 2015.  I got rejected for those too.
p3148
aV@MDGonzales Is Arrieta definitely going to make that start with his lingering hammy issues?
p3149
aV@si_mlb @si_MLB oh look Javy even does fake PBP during the games https://t.co/6ZCdc5usZP
p3150
aV@si_mlb @si_mlb https://t.co/x27feGrzsw
p3151
aV@Si_MLB corrected article to say Cubs did it 1st but said Yankees was way better.  Have they seen Javy pretending t\u2026 https://t.co/ymgLuBtSF4
p3152
aV@TonyAndracki23 I don't like SI and Deadspin making it look like the Yankees invented this celebration.  They are m\u2026 https://t.co/xxzOZWb62d
p3153
aV@george4593 @si_mlb 100% correct. And Starlin you should be ashamed of yourself.
p3154
aV@si_mlb https://t.co/uVd5bY763l\u000a\u000aCubs have been doing this since August
p3155
aVHoly crap #Cubs fans, we've been ripped off and Starlin is at the center of it! https://t.co/wATKbIOh5I
p3156
aV@si_mlb They stole it from the Cubs
p3157
aV@FullCountTommy @TonyAndracki23 I will say Lackey is good insurance if Jake or Lester aren't effective and have sho\u2026 https://t.co/wzSBZ6lPMo
p3158
aV@FullCountTommy @TonyAndracki23 Not that Wilson would be pitching in key ABs as a LOOGY but good to have extra LH arm in there just in case.
p3159
aV@FullCountTommy @TonyAndracki23 Definitely no Grimm.  I still keep Wilson over Lackey.  Lackey starts games slow, w\u2026 https://t.co/k4Knk1QN8q
p3160
aV@ivychat @MLB That sounds awesome except what happens if there's a tiebreaker game required?
p3161
aV@DarrylDK57KIle So you've also lost respect for every team that's ever clinched a division on the road including the Cardinals?
p3162
aV@BleacherNation Im not worried about blowing it or anything, I'd just like to see a clinch as fast as possible to s\u2026 https://t.co/qEq38Y2vho
p3163
aVWacha is absolutely owning the Cubs right now. He's in complete command
p3164
aV@lizsicle Dallas Cowboys. Then I'd turn around and sell them for $3B and buy the Cubs
p3165
aV@FullCountTommy @daynperry Park Dale
p3166
aVGarPax goes from completely ignoring 3 point shooting to making it the only attribute that matters. https://t.co/oRAM6irpzw
p3167
aV@BullsBlogger @desipiodotcom Wait, he's our tank commander!
p3168
aV@ByAZuniga So glad we didn't end up hiring Pitino back in the day.  I could not handle another UM Hoops scandal
p3169
aV@desipiodotcom To be fair, all he did was scream "GET ME THE HELL OUT OF HERE" out the windows of the Advocate Center
p3170
aV@edwardwburns @GaryParrishCBS They are going to give him the stiffest punishment possible - He will be playing his college career at DePaul
p3171
aVRick Pitino's last NCAA Game will likely be a loss to Michigan
p3172
aV@ltblaize Why? I want the Brewers to win so there's no chance at a backdoor clinching. But if Cubs take a nice early lead, Go Reds!
p3173
aV@CFCubsRelated @realcubsinsider Unbelievable how dated that looks. Still feels like only a few years ago
p3174
aV@RandallJSanders @Shep670 Also Schwarber game winning grand slam vs. STL at Wrigley\u000a\u000aThe late inning comeback in Wa\u2026 https://t.co/axe3OMRZ1X
p3175
aV@umhoops I would be shocked if UM was implicated, but at the same time I don't think I can say with certainty that any school is clean.
p3176
aV@joerexrode @Balas_Wolverine Nice knowing you Louisville basketball program
p3177
aV@Darth_Stout Possibly, but if he pitches Sunday, he's pitching Game 1 on regular rest vs. 10 days rest.  His arm is fresh
p3178
aV@RobertONeill31 If it makes you feel any better I went to potential clinchers in 15 and 16 and they lost them both \U0001f621
p3179
aVRT @DEvanAltman: Tommy Pham is an anagram for "phat mommy," so there's that.
p3180
aV@LaurenceWHolmes is killing it on the Score right now talking about what happened this weekend
p3181
aV@MannyElk @ByScottPowers No outrage from this Hawks fan Think theyre better than this but there was a lot of change\u2026 https://t.co/DPokvD3jxV
p3182
aV@Bulls_Peck Valentine went out of his way to praise DWade's influence in a tweet today.
p3183
aV@DavidHaugh This is my biggest hope for this team.  A 20 win team that plays fun basketball much better then depres\u2026 https://t.co/fkcyQbZ5Fv

aVYet wouldn't even consider Kaepernick when Tannehill went down? Had to beg Cutler out of broadcast booth instead https://t.co/xy3ZVAdB3Q
p3185
aV@nonsequitur20 @darrenrovell @mcuban @CNBC @FoxNews He cares about what anyone who speaks negatively of him has to\u2026 https://t.co/i4UnQM2mAi
p3186
aV@darrenrovell @mcuban @CNBC Wish he could get on @FoxNews to say that so Trump would actually hear that.
p3187
aVRT @297lynette: How is kneeling during the anthem disrespectful to the military but wanting to kick out transgender soldiers is not? Bullsh\u2026

aV#Cubs can clinch baseball beyond game 162 with a win tonight
p3190
aV@DrCubColclasure Nah, if they sweep the Cubs who have gone 44-23 in 2nd half and Cardinals sweep the Brewers and if\u2026 https://t.co/RflpyIwsO0

aV@ClarkMetAddison see: 2016 NLCS
p3192
aV@ClarkMetAddison Dude goes on slumps and usually comes out of them in a huge way
p3193
aV@Rob_In_WI Dammit I almost made a "Tweeting during the first TO in OT? How dare you!" Reply
p3194
aV@Rob_In_WI Sorry I was making a "respect the flag" joke haha
p3195
aV@Rob_In_WI Was someone kneeling during it??
p3196
aVWhy are libs obsessing about who can use what bathroom when there are more import-HEY THAT DUDE IS KNEELING DURING THE ANTHEM! DEPORT THEM!
p3197
aV@BrandonBJustice Is it worse ending than the Bears game in 2010?
p3198
aV@TheHackedPC @DaBearsBros We did!
p3199
aV@WaddleandSilvy What about the fumble vs GB with the playoffs on the line that no Bear went for?
p3200
aVThere's actually still a non-zero chance the Bears could make something of season. But not with stiff ass Glennon in there
p3201
aV@RobertONeill31 I don't think he's better at all. Rex could move the ball down field and could actually move around\u2026 https://t.co/oCxHNd4Rua
p3202
aVYeah he did not give any indication that his presidency would be like this during the campaign... #bullshit https://t.co/TBE6I07IeG
p3203
aV@VCorral23 Especially the late arrivers who felt they had to make a statement because everyone else was *cough* Bears
p3204
aV@Vancouver_Leafs JJ Nelson is questionable and in a MNF game so there's always a chance he doesn't play and leaves you high and dry
p3205
aV@ClarkMetAddison Ha. Hahaha. HAHAHAHA thanks for the laugh after a tough ending to the game \U0001f602
p3206
aVWade Davis last 8 games: 6 appearances, 130 pitches, 7.1 IP
p3207
aV@Slaughter_Rule @krechenmacher Yeah because he's pitched like a billion innings over the last 9 days
p3208
aVHey Joe, you are supposed to wait until the WS to overwork your closer to the point of ineffectiveness.
