aVH. Clinton has written 6 books (herself, not ghost-writers).  It turns out, that you get royalties from writing books.  CRAZY.
p1375
aV@elizabethforma @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump Keeping that Supreme court seat vacate is a wasted effort; H. Clinton will be filling it.
p1376
aVLOSERS like @realDonaldTrump always complain about the playing field and the refs.  Winners just play better.
p1377
aVWhy does @realDonaldTrump keep arguing for more nuclear weapons; more for us and other powers?  This is not making me feel safe.
p1378
aVI seem to remember Hillary Clinton doing something about health care. For a DECADE #nineties
p1379
aV@GOP @HillaryClinton to quote Mr. Cohen, D. Trump surrogate, "says who?"
p1380
aVHow do I know this supposed massive "Trump tax audit" is not going to be finished by Nov. 8?  I would bet my bottom dollar on it.
p1381
aVActually, H. Clinton helped eliminate the loophole he used when he took the 917 million dollar loss.
p1382
aV"I know nothing about Russia."  Great thing for a president to claim.
p1383
aV@realDonaldTrump "Give me your tired, your poor,\u000aYour huddled masses yearning to breathe free"  Doesn't Trump live in New York?
p1384
aV@realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton Disaster is pretty clear; that is why the D. Trump campaign is now called a disaster.  Just ask Republicans
p1385
aV@realDonaldTrump being " a gentleman" is under debate.
p1386
aV@realDonaldTrump is unhinged.  Once again speaking over Clinton.
p1387
aVTrump: "If I win, I'm going to [persecute my political opponent.]"  Is @realDonaldTrump running for 3rd World Dictator or US President.
p1388
aVHe is already rambling incoherently.  He is jumping from attack to attack without sequiturs.
p1389
aVOf course there are words in a debate @realDonaldTrump.  That is how debates work.  Man, you should have prepared a little more.
p1390
aVTo quote the best episode of the West Wing.  Game On! #debate
p1391
aVTrump is truly a repugnant human being.  I look forward to him being trounced tonight and on Nov 8th. https://t.co/0qh66oHC9m
p1392
aVI made a joke to this effect during the Republican National Convention (when Queen told Trump he could't use their\u2026 https://t.co/iDhIFSAsJF
p1393
aVThere is only one competent candidate with a viable chance to win @HillaryClinton. Anyone truly repulsed by Trump should be WITH HER as well
p1394
aVIf the Republicans abandoning Trump were truly courageous with the interest of the nation at heart, they would be advocating for Clinton now
p1395
aVPence has not been vetted; he didn't even run.  Republicans chose a nominee via a democratic primary election.  There is no deus-ex-machina.
p1396
aVEngaging in magical thinking and attempting to pull a rabbit candidate out of a hat is not responsible.  It is childish and pathetic.
p1397
aVIt is very difficult for Republicans to vote for @HillaryClinton after 2 decades of vilifying her.   But if they truly want to stop Trump...
p1398
aVRepublicans abandoning @realDonaldTrump are cowards.  They are elected and are expected to make difficult decisions not duck and cover.
p1399
aVSkol @Vikings!!!! 5-0 going into the bye week.  They have beaten 3 playoff teams from last year (dismantling 2 of them).  #SKOL
p1400
aV@realDonaldTrump I'm glad you are not leaving the race.  I look forward to H. @HillaryClinton wiping the floor with you on Nov 8. #election
p1401
aVCan Trump even be trusted to act civilized on the world stage?  What if he attempts to grope a foreign leader? Trial at the Hague?
p1402
aVLike his friend Roger Ailes, @realDonaldTrump is a sexual predator, who uses his 'power' to take advantage of women.  Birds of a feather...
p1403
aV@lordtiberius I'm sorry, is this reply supposed to make sense?  You are delusional; you should go back on your medications.
p1404
aVJack Kingston, fmr Rep Georgia, an apologist for Trump is disgraceful.  Party affiliation above all; would support a serial killer if #GOP
p1405
aVForced to give an apology due to circumstances, he is unable to leave it there.  In 90 seconds he pivoted to attacking the Clintons.  #AWFUL
p1406
aVA sociopath is someone without any concept of other people's needs or feelings.  I think this is the best description of @realDonaldTrump
p1407
aVBBC News - Trump courts the terminally ill vote https://t.co/IxugrlwCAm\u000aA metaphor for the Trump campaign: Living on a Prayer.
p1408
aV@ThomasLeventhal Is he using the line: "What do you have to lose?" on this demographic as well?
p1409
aV@realDonaldTrump is this a joke?  You interrupted Sec. Clinton like a toddler with ADD.  Attempt to limit your hypocrisy.
p1410
aVTrump claims that if you can't name an enemy you can't defeat it; Pence can't say the words "systemic racism" or "institutional bias."
p1411
aV@mike_pence when Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals, he said ""And some, I assume, are good people." NOT MANY.
p1412
aV@realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton is that all you got Donald?  There are only so many times you can beat that dead horse.
p1413
aVThe empty words that Trump uses to support are extremely empty when he also says that our military is a disaster.
p1414
aVPence claims Trump supports our troops... but only with empty words, not by paying taxes apparently.
p1415
aVBut ISIS makes such a great bogeyman.  Never let the facts get in the way of really good demagoguery.
p1416
aVPence should pay closer attention to current events. ISIS is close to losing Mosul and their 'caliphate.'
p1417
aV@realDonaldTrump @GeeVeeM @Susiesentinel at least someone on your ticket is able to do homework.
p1418
aVPence and Republican stance on police shootings and mass killings.  "Grieve" for for these tragedies and then not do a shit to prevent them.
p1419
aV@GOP already posting that Pence won the debate tonight.  Really takes away the drama; perhaps the view is not unbiased. #incompetent
p1420
aV@realDonaldTrump might answer the "call" at 3am.  But does anyone truly believe he would say anything useful?
p1421
aV@CortesSteve Do you think you wife, daughters and sisters appreciate being used as political props?  @realDonaldTrump is sexist.
p1422
aV@realDonaldTrump If this man pays no taxes.  He is not the genius.  His accountants are.   Are they running for president?
p1423
aV@realDonaldTrump you might answer the call; but apparently you won't have anything constructive to say.
p1424
aVDoes @realDonaldTrump realize that USA is populated by 51% females.  So maybe fat-shaming and tweeting about sex tapes is counter-productive
p1425
aVIt takes a special kind of incompetence to not even realize you have made a mistake.  @realDonaldTrump is delusional.  #MissUniverse
p1426
aVTrump has proven Benjamin Franklin wrong about Death and Taxes, apparently only one is certain
p1427
aVMost surprising thing I have learned about Climate Change: I didn't know Al Gore was Chinese.
p1428
aV@realDonaldTrump What do you call a man who doesn't adequately prepare for the most important interview in his life?  A LOSER.
p1429
