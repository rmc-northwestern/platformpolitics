aV@SinupretSa saline in the neti pot.  Changes the interior balance?
p366
aV@SinupretSa In summary: use clean/distilled water in the neti pot.  I am also concerned about washing out the "good" nasal substances.
p367
aV@SinupretSa and also begs the question: is neti pot actually harmful in non-bacterial/viral cases such as rhinitis/allergy sufferers?
p368
aV@SinupretSa I know a gluten sensitive person who swears by probiotics and enzymes for restoration.  But yeah, unknown for sinuses yet.
p369
aV@SinupretSa great article!  So perhaps some probiotics are in order?  Similar theory to those an intestinal imbalance due to, e.g., candida?
