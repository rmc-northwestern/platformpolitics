aV@bartongellman Maybe you could become a restaurant critic...
p976
aV@bartongellman With the Post's new stance on Edward Snowden, you won't have to worry about any new whistleblowers coming to you with info...
p977
aV@bartongellman Pretty sad to read your 6/7/13 PRISM article and then see at the bottom "The Post Recommends: No Pardon for Edward Snowden"
p978

aV@sxbegle You can't add a different sequence to the opposite strand of an existing sequence, they won't match up...
p993
aV@sxbegle CRISPR makes a double-stranded break, so the"Meet CRISPR" video is confusing...
p994
aV@UKWorlds Please update the live stream schedule page as soon as you add a game.  The USA vs Japan game is over and is still not added.  Thx
p995
aV@SpaceX Bravo!  Congratulations to your successful satellite deployment!!

aV@andrewrsorkin You're right about organic food! Needlessly expensive! Amino acids don't care where they get their nitrogen from!
p999
aV@JoeSquawk You're right about organic food!  No value in the added expense. Amino acids don't care where they get their nitrogen from!
p1000
aV@jrkelly Please always educate about genetic engineering and organic farming!  Amino acids don't care where they get their nitrogen from!

aV@google So are you going to enable government backdoor hacks into Android phones?  Silence speaks louder than words. Shame on you.
p1009
aVRT @Snowden: This is the most important tech case in a decade. Silence means @google picked a side, but it's not the public's.  https://t.c\u2026
p1010
aV@tim_cook  Please stand your ground and do not allow a hack into the iPhone.  A secure backdoor is an oxymoron.

aV@ngnultimate In the video player, lower the video quality from High to Medium or Mobile, working for me. No wind now , great Pitt comeback!
