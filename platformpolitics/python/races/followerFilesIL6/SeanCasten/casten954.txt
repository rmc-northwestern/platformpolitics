aV@TwitsForMiles sure. I just think it better to make gun nuts defend guns than argue against guns in schools because teachers are unbalanced.
p2896
aV@TwitsForMiles I'm on your side, but this seems more like an argument for getting rid of insane teachers than anything else.

p3194
aV@LeahVanNorstran sent!
p3195
aV@LeahVanNorstran @lawyermatt I think sep of church and state probably prevents forcing pastor in place. Now, what about the rest?
p3196
aV@lawyermatt @LeahVanNorstran yeah, 30 years ago. Not today. That's a huge difference.
p3197
aV@LeahVanNorstran now help me shake some sense into Matt!!! :-)
p3198
aV@LeahVanNorstran if ur really going to call and be an advocate for LGBT issues, ur absolutely not a bigot and I welcome you in this fight!
p3199
aV@lawyermatt @LeahVanNorstran people standing for gay rights today who were bad two decades ago deserve more scorn than today's opponents? Ok
p3200
aV@LeahVanNorstran wasn't directed at you, my friend. We're cool. Was asking Matt
p3201
aV@lawyermatt @LeahVanNorstran haven't*
p3202
aV@lawyermatt @LeahVanNorstran you still have answered: even if hypothetical, should it be legal to fire/evict for being gay?
p3203
aV@lawyermatt @LeahVanNorstran 23 years ago, some people took a stupid vote. And that's your excuse for continuing it today? Pretty thin, Matt
p3204
aV@lawyermatt @LeahVanNorstran wasn't even close to voting age in '93. And your argument boils down to "we're as bad now as they were then."
p3205
aV@lawyermatt @LeahVanNorstran you're arguing who created the problem 20 years ago. I'm arguing who's trying to fix it today.
p3206
aV@lawyermatt @LeahVanNorstran our party has evolved and gotten right on the issue. Half of state legislatures have too. So why not help?
p3207
aV@lawyermatt @LeahVanNorstran true or false, Matt: someone in TN can be fired for being gay.
p3208
aV@lawyermatt @LeahVanNorstran of course. so fed passed insufficient law. Nearly half of states passed protections. TN hasn't.
p3209
aV@Sweetie4Prez @LeahVanNorstran what's SJW?
p3210
aV@lawyermatt @LeahVanNorstran because title 7 of EEOC CRA is hard to enforce, the lack of state specific protection allows for firing/evicts
p3211
aV@lawyermatt @LeahVanNorstran sure! https://t.co/OVzoKiUd4m
p3212
aV@LeahVanNorstran great let's chat next week. Anxious to hear how it goes!
p3213
aV@LeahVanNorstran so you won't help?
p3214
aV@LeahVanNorstran you're saying you would. You have a chance right now! This isn't a hypothetical.
p3215
aV@LeahVanNorstran awww sorry I hurt your feelings. Totally sane response to now take it out on evicted and fired gay ppl. Sure showed me.
p3216
aV@LeahVanNorstran so you're not willing to call the lawmakers you voted for to ask them to stop evicting and firing gay people?
p3217
aV@LeahVanNorstran oh I'm always ugly. Not a good looking man. But asking u to lobby ur lawmakers to stop evicting gay people is hardly mean.
p3218
aV@LeahVanNorstran sure.  But this is a pretty big one. And do you call and complain? Protest? Go lobby your lawmakers.
p3219
aV@LeahVanNorstran if only your ballot was as full of love as your heart. How does your heart allow you to support gay being being evicted?
p3220
aV@LeahVanNorstran you're right me calling you something doesn't make it so. Your votes and opinions on the other hand...
p3221
aV@LeahVanNorstran just so I'm clear, you're saying you're not responsible for the laws passed by the lawmakers you voted for?
p3222
aV@BertDifig1 @chippergaines @KateAurthur @ginamei sorry. I should be more accepting of your intolerance.
p3223
aV@LeahVanNorstran if I'm wrong, please defend the laws and your votes in support.
p3224
aV@LeahVanNorstran I've never mentioned Christian once. You're a bigot because you support bigoted laws.
p3225
aV@LeahVanNorstran so you're voting against GOP in TN that's passing laws allowing firing and evicting of gay ppl?
p3226
aV@LeahVanNorstran your home stat allows for gays to be fired or evicted just for being gay. If you've voted GOP in TN, there's your example.
p3227
aV@LeahVanNorstran but you don't support gay marriage? What about the laws that allow for gay people to be fired and evicted?
p3228
