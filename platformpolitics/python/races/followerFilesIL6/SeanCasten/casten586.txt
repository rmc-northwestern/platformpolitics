aV@linkinpark @JKCorden @latelateshow @KIIARA guys.  In all seriousness what is up with the new song?  It's horrible
p434
aV@nigelcameron yup.  And to you, fewer public state department employees "hobbles America".  Its a hot take!
p435
aV@nigelcameron so you are equating headcount with influence.  Interesting!
p436
aV@nigelcameron cutting State hobbles America?  Can you specify how?
p437
aV@jygriebel highly doubtful.  Though I am trying my best to give her the benefit of the doubt!
p438
aV@jygriebel Thanks for the explanation!  Guess I was "impressed" that she even acknowledged HBCUs.  Let's just say my expectations are low...
p439
aV@RichardHaass do you agree with that assertion?
p440
aV@mattyglesias @jmzzz always the case for R presidents
p441
aV@hughhewitt that attitude is why he got 3m fewer votes?  I'm confused.
p442
aV@jbarro it's gang related so q is why fewer/less intense gangs in NYC?
p443
aV@MarketUrbanism @jbarro sorry but this makes no sense
p444
aV@jbarro what do you think explains it?
p445
aVRT @JimGaffigan: I'm optimistic about this week. Just kidding. I'm sure it will be horrible.
p446
aV@JessicaYellin Are you sure she deleted it?  I think I just saw it up there.
p447
aV@FrankLuntz @HotlineJosh umm this data is 4 yrs old
p448
aV@that76spirit @jbarro This Week on ABC
p449
aV@jbarro he's going on a Sunday show.  That could be great.
p450
aV@AriMelber @maddow @Gawker @nicknotned why does she assume that no billionaire would pay the legal defenses of the news orgs?
p451
aV@judebirch yeah I like him a lot too.
p452
aV@judebirch except that he predicted Trump would lose
p453
aV@djrothkopf what's SIG?
p454
aV@neeratanden @SusanSarandon on the list of whom to blame for the Democratic nominee's loss to Donald Trump, Sarandon is really far down.
p455
aV@Anthony I gotta say they have amazing flowers.  And abt half the price of CVS's.
p456
aV@NateSilver538 that person is Seth Moulton...
p457
aV@BFriedmanDC @pinkbunny70 6) who is the prime minister of France?; 7) how many people live in the US?; 8) what's the biggest country?...
p458
aV@GovHowardDean @pinkbunny70 how do you know he truly believes this?
p459
aV@mattyglesias disagree.  It's reasonable to seriously question the judgment of anyone who supported or remained silent on Trump.
p460
aV@StephensWSJ and pre-9/11, for that matter
p461
aV@danpfeiffer source?
p462
aV@JasonKander @Tumultuous was the electoral college?
p463
aV@ellismads why is that guy so nervous??
p464
aV@charlescwcooke writ won't be granted here
p465
aV@MiltonWolfMD is this really smart for her to be doing?  She did lose to him which is incredibly embarrassing
p466
aV@JoeNBC how so?
p467
aV@igorbobic didn't they gain seats?
p468
aV@JoeNBC specifically, how is it "constitutionally weak"?
p469
aV@AriMelber is she correct?
p470
aV@jbarro absolutely zero chance it would be 8-0.  Thomas and/or Alito will side w Trump.  7-1 possible.
p471
aV@jeremyscahill haha.  Almost as good as msnbc's countdown clock to Chris Hayes's town hall on Chicago violence.
p472
aV@ReformedBroker seems this has happened abt 20 straight quarters
p473
aV@KenGardner11 hmm Harvard law professor but not bright?  Yikes.  Even republicans would disagree on that one.
p474
aV@sacca @HuffPostPol so what's your vote?  Strong or weak $?
p475
aV@jjauthor where do you think the government should get revenue?
p476
aV@jjauthor huh?
p477
aV@dandrezner obviously there is no question they 100% will
p478
aV@danielschuman meh
p479
aV@jjauthor where is your evidence for that accusation?  Do you have any?
p480
aV@NickBaumann I will.  Just sayin, the strong v weak dollar issue is legit.  (Flynn prob isn't the guy to ask but still)
p481
aV@neeratanden Neera -- is it bad?  I assume you know the answer re a strong or weak dollar?
p482
aV@TVietor08 @hotelkeys @HuffPostPol Tommy -- do you prefer a strong or weak dollar?
p483
aV@NickBaumann so Nick -- can you tell us whether a strong or weak dollar is better?
p484
aV@RyanDetrick why so little volatility after the gap I wonder?
p485
aV@Austan_Goolsbee meh. Everyone watches the SuperBowl, every year.
p486
aV@ChrisJansing do you ever get concerned that you report useless information?
p487
aV@ChrisJansing you wonder why people criticize but you still report useless information.  Come on!!
p488
aV@ChrisJansing so seriously -- is this really news?
p489
aV@blakehounshell why is this stunning?
p490
aV@thehill why do Chelsea Clinton's tweets qualify as "news"?
p491
aV@ErikLoomis only inefficient if the line exists all day
p492
aV@neeratanden why wouldn't they be?
p493
aV@sebastianbach oh man that's horrible
p494
aV@poniewozik this past season of the Affair
p495
aV@sebastianbach haha fair point!
p496
aV@sebastianbach do you not like dogs??
p497
aVRT @BrookeBCNN: .@HowardStern: just said it on TV; sure would love to interview you about @realDonaldTrump. Retweet if you agree Howard wou\u2026
p498
aV@oliverdarcy 100%?
p499
aV@bethanyshondark totally.  Trump is usually so peaceful.
p500
aV@ReformedBroker fake news
p501
aV@ClistonBrown @CNN lol they will mostly surrender obviously
p502
aV@jonathanalter interesting.  So is anyone invoking this law?  Or is it just a fun thing for you to post?
p503
aV@matthewamiller @jkarsh nope.  He'll be confirmed very quickly.
p504
aV@stutteringjohnm let me know how I can help out!
p505
aV@ericspiegelman nah no dem is voting for him except manchin maybe
p506
aV@chrislhayes @nycsouthpaw thanks for the speculation guys!
p507
aV@SarahSpain totally.  Although probably the outcome Yates was hoping for...
p508
aV@NormOrnstein @aravosis lol you must be kidding Norm
p509
aV@aubrey_huff on saturdays and sundays?
p510
aV@jimcramer where and when does tax reform happen?  Has anyone talked about it in the past week?
p511
aV@jimcramer maybe markets are wondering when we'll see movement on tax reform instead of protests at airports?
p512
aV@marie_ramsdal OK I will be checking!
p513
aV@marie_ramsdal I want to get involved but can't do tonight.  Need help tomorrow?
p514
aV@toddstarnes what's your point?
p515
aV@SarahSpain who wrote it?
p516
aV@dandrezner https://t.co/0zVkuHqJPK
p517
aV@dandrezner it was not really a "purge".  Pretty normal stuff actually.
p518
aV@bmaz @BobMcGovernJr how so?
p519
aV@chrislhayes you're a reporter?
p520
aV@RiskReversal only some staff.  Very small %
p521
aV@stutteringjohnm who is that?  (On the left)
p522
aV@CharlesMBlow do they cost any $ to attend?
p523
aV@chrislhayes this is kinda dumb
p524
aV@jakebeckman agree.  And that person should be The Rock
p525
aV@jimcramer why not just put up 2 signs and have 2 lanes?  "Mobile" and "In-store".
p526
aV@JakePlunkett I'm hearing them too from Greenwich village.  Fireworks display on Jan 26?
p527
aV@alexburnsNYT I wonder if there a single exampl in 20 mos. of those 3 stopping Trump on anything or affecting his support level, whatsoever?
p528
aV@karaswisher he's made this claim in the past so hard to say it wasn't expected
p529
aV@Genevieve_Marie @SusanSarandon gen is absolutely right
p530
aV@Nouriel wow!  So true!
p531
aV@AriFleischer lol oh man
p532
aV@heytana hi Tana!  What did you think of today's protests??
p533
aV@bobsaget what a stupid tweet
p534
aV@bethanyshondark @bdomenech it would happen but wouldn't draw 5m+ like today's did.
p535
aV@shaneferro what was spiders statement?
p536
aV@neeratanden yup, and the 1900s
p537
aV@RollingStone this is awesome!
p538
aV@ZekeJMiller is there also a Churchill bust in there now too?
p539
aV@ReformedBroker not a trump guy but I actually don't see anything wrong with having a few GS guys in top positions.  They're good.
p540
aV@brianstelter @jpodhoretz lol seriously
p541
aV@TomiLahren any chance you're actually the problem??
p542
aV@TerryMoran no, he said he didn't "think so".
p543
aV@nielslesniewski what's that
p544
aV@jpodhoretz @HarlanCoben plenty of things in your lifetime that were just as jaw dropping.
p545
aV@brianefallon @aravosis @Susan_Hennessey do you have any evidence for this insinuation?
p546
aV@mattyglesias the state dept stuff is even more disturbing.  Does Rex even have a deputy?  (P.s.  Rex has no experience)
p547
aV@jpodhoretz @BraddJaffy LOL.  You mean you don't agree that he's the most qualified diplomat on earth??
p548
aV@DavidAFrench Obama was an excellent President.
p549
aV@DavidAFrench nah it's flown by
p550
aV@SarahPalinUSA what is your position on this?  Untrue??
p551
aV@HugoNRambo @Lawrence @mikedalaserbeam I was asking O'Donnell
p552
aV@Lawrence @mikedalaserbeam what does "one of the best" mean?  Out of how many?
p553
aV@KrisinAL @jjauthor @obritom @ChuckNellis meh
p554
aV@KrisinAL @jjauthor @obritom @ChuckNellis evidence for that claim?
p555
aV@VanessaGrimaldi looked so painful
p556
aV@danpfeiffer well dude, not surprising w trumps approval at 32%...
p557
aV@gehrig38 @yagottagotomo Schill, do you have any proof it's real?
p558
aV@SarahSpain @EdwardTHardy trying to determine any "logic" on Trump supporters is totally useless.
p559
aV@SethAMandel spread of nukes in the Middle East?  To whom?
p560
aV@axlrose you should run in 2020!
p561
aV@jaynordlinger only beating Trump by 3m makes her a bad candidate.  (Imagine how many votes obama would have won by).
p562
aV@Toure I've seen much lower than that.  I saw 38% somewhere recently
p563
aV@mattyglesias perhaps he was charged under seal?
p564
aV@danielschuman this has Booker skipping the inauguration which I don't believe is correct.
p565
aV@benshapiro @kevinbinversie source?
p566
aV@rtraister how so?
p567
aV@mfore0142 @ananavarro @jtwainright wait so do you think Ana is a "commentator"?   And what does that mean??
p568
aV@cabaum1 @kevincorke why is this a great map Caroline?
p569
aV@ananavarro @mfore0142 @jtwainright what exactly is a "commentator"?  Seriously?
p570
aV@Scottys_Tweets @jtstrickland86 @nickgillespie what's IRL
p571
aV@jtstrickland86 @nickgillespie @Scottys_Tweets Dan donegan, Kirk Hammett, slash, billy Armstrong, John frusciante, etc
p572
aV@jtstrickland86 @nickgillespie @Scottys_Tweets but many more too!
p573
aV@jtstrickland86 @nickgillespie @Scottys_Tweets he is amazing
p574
aV@jtstrickland86 @nickgillespie @Scottys_Tweets sure.  Or communists, as Morello admits
p575
aV@jonfavs LOL.  Hilarious that you still think Trump's lies matter.
p576
aV@Firedup2020 @neeratanden big protest in NYC thurs night...
p577
aV@nickgillespie @Scottys_Tweets how are they not libertarian?
p578
aV@quintywinties oh man
p579
aV@neeratanden @joshuadubois hmmm.  maybe he means he won't be critical of POTUS on Syria?
p580
aV@jbarro @ObsoleteDogma ain't going lower than 35% no matter what
p581
aV@jbarro @ObsoleteDogma will this get Trump in trouble?  Guess his approval dips to 35% from 37%?
p582
aV@DanaPerino thanks
p583
aV@mattyglesias has he or any of his staff ever given a concrete, detailed example of a single "great deal" he's made?
p584
aV@crampell but then he answered the question the third time, and denied it.
p585
aV@CaroleRadziwill Lewis has said he's not attending.  Same w 18 other reps.
p586
aV@GideonResnick I don't agree.  If the Dems run a candidate who is not Hillary they will win easily.  Would have been true this year too.
p587
aV@piersmorgan looks horrible
p588
aV@alexwagner @thegarance @GlennThrush @CBSPolitics probably around 34-35%.  Trump voters are very loyal.
p589
aV@SopanDeb why is that strange?
p590
aV@BrandyLJensen @AthertonKD no
p591
aV@matthewjdowd @hotelkeys I assume they will just call the polls fake news?
p592
aV@EmilyMiller @AfroAmerMuseum @ReutersPolitics are you still a huge Trump supporter?
p593
aV@bethanyshondark what happens at Star Trek conventions?
p594
aV@Batee555 @SamWangPhD @RadioFreeTom yeah but I don't get how he can confidently predict 98% or whatever for months on end despite new facts
p595
aV@SimonMaloy umm
p596
aV@chrislhayes no shot.  Republicans will get their way as usual
p597
aV@EW meh.  Is this really interesting to anyone?
p598
aVRT @rkennedy1051: Just saw #PatriotsDay respect to the men and woman who lost sleep to protect Americans. Great movie though. 10/10 @patrio\u2026
p599
aVRT @marlayoung: @patriotsdayfilm Just finished watching #PatriotsDayMovie about 2013 Boston Marathon Bombing. I highly recommend you see it\u2026
p600
aVRT @Matoxman: @iftscouldfly @CBSFilms @patriotsdayfilm it was so good!!  Best film of the year hands down.
p601
aV@iftscouldfly @CBSFilms @patriotsdayfilm it was so good!!  Best film of the year hands down.
p602
aV@mattyglesias @jbarro yeah but if he had, you know it would have only hurt Hillary.
p603
aV@TheFix what exactly impressed you about him?  Is he talking about the dollar getting "debased" again?
p604
aV@SallieKrawcheck so what did you do??
p605
aV@MrChuckD @prophetsofrage what a great fuckin picture
p606
aV@seanmdav @ChasFlemming @CarlBialik @Crimealytics no, he was skewered for constantly saying crime has "never been worse".
p607
aV@weareyourfek @caroljdavy why?  Can you give details?
p608
aV@chrislhayes except President/VP
p609
aV@kevinbacon @patriotsdayfilm @EmbassyCinema Kevin -- this movie was so awesome!  Saw in Union Sq Sat night.  Congrats!!
p610
aV@sarahkendzior @USATODAY "did business under Tillerson"?  Huh?  What does that even mean?
p611
aV@DonCheadle are you actually trying to reason with a Trump supporter?  Very difficult!
p612
aV@cenkuygur did you like when she said Hollywood actors are among the most persecuted people?
p613
aV@Firedup2020 @SarahSpain @serve1 Booker?  Biden?  Howard Schultz?  A celebrity/actor?
p614
aV@Firedup2020 @SarahSpain @serve1 first step is gains in 2018, then a halfway decent candidate for 2020 (with very little baggage)
p615
aV@Firedup2020 @SarahSpain @serve1 agree 100%.
p616
aV@SarahSpain @serve1 nope.  All we have is what's on that tape.  He denies his intent, while many others think it was obvious.
p617
aV@Firedup2020 @SarahSpain @serve1 but we have to acknowledge he has abt 45m votes that will never be swayed.  Perhaps other 15m are get-able
p618
aV@Firedup2020 @SarahSpain @serve1 yup.  And taking over w full employment and the stock market at a record high.  Gonna be tough to improve!
p619
aV@Firedup2020 @SarahSpain @serve1 agree although I guess he'll deny his intent forever
p620
aV@SarahSpain @serve1 trump denied tonight that he ever made fun of the reporter's handicap
p621
aV@TomiLahren what abt MMA?
p622
aV@cenkuygur also, why does he refuse to say anything bad about Trump?  It's alarming.
p623
aV@MeghanMcCain @billyeichner and trump is totally outside the bubble, right?
p624
aV@AshleyRParker oh, just give it time...
p625
aV@JDVance1 @rkylesmith maybe bc she thinks MMA is disgusting?  The speech was terrible but that actually seems like a reasonable position.
p626
aV@bethanyshondark @MZHemingway nope.  Hollywood has nothing to do with why Trump won.  He won bc 75k voters in WI/MI/PA didn't like Hillary
p627
aV@SethAMandel nah.  Dems put up anyone better than Hillary and they'll win easily.
p628
aV@MeghanMcCain no it's not.  Trump won bc Hillary is an unpopular person who could not win PA/MI/WI
p629
aV@bethanyshondark it has no effect on 2020.  If the Dems nominate a better candidate than Hillary they'll win easily.
p630
aV@RepStevenSmith that's not very nice
p631
aV@JoeNBC @nytimes also check Tehran.  (I wrote my Princeton thesis on it)
p632
aV@CrtvPrdx @anamariecox no walter white?  Or at least Hank Schrader?
p633
aV@SallyAlbright assume you mean in US, not worldwide?
p634
aV@BradMossEsq thanks for doing great work Brad!  Keep it up!
p635
aV@jjauthor Where are you getting this info?  It's totally incorrect!!
p636
aV@NormEisen although it's not a crisis for them, considering every one of them will get confirmed...
p637
aVCheck out my new drumming vid!  Been messing around w/some G N R...\u000a\u000ahttps://t.co/XuBWJ9R90l
p638
aV@PierceSergenian @jjauthor @RecorderTweets nice!  I am a litigator with biglaw experience who is looking, but I'm in NYC.
p639
aV@KeithOlbermann have you ever thought of blaming his supporters rather than solely blaming him?
p640
aV@jjauthor @PierceSergenian @RecorderTweets wonder if they're hiring??
p641
aV@danpfeiffer I guess but the dem base doesn't really sit around watching TV quite as much
p642
aV@JohnJHarwood is there a need to constantly retweet his every statement, while paraphrasing?  We all have twitter and can read.
p643
aV@jbarro @JoeNBC visiting WI would not have won her PA (where she went frequently)
p644
aV@brianstelter doesn't your show spend a lot of time talking abt his tweets?
p645
aV@SteveRattner Hamilton.
p646
aV@gehrig38 what are you saying?  You want him to threaten which groups, exactly?
p647
aV@ChrisCuomo @BeebopSplinter would you call them intelligent people?
p648
aV@bethanyshondark was it a good year for you Bethany?
p649
aV@NicolleDWallace @pkersh not enough Americans care for this to mean anything in practice
p650
aV@NicolleDWallace @pkersh lolz.  What can they POSSIBLY do once Trump is in power in 3 weeks?
p651
aV@jbarro @mattyglesias 56% think economy has gotten better or stayed abt the same.  Equals his approval %
p652
aV@mtaibbi oh I'm definitely buying this one!
p653
aV@bethanyshondark @bookschicago @simonschuster let's not forget Hillary was the preferred choice of 3m more people
p654
aV@EBrooksUncut LA Angels; Toronto Blue Jays
p655
aV@ylanmui @thegarance @washingtonpost wasn't this already announced?  Part of the 50k total??
p656
aV@chrislhayes @samsteinhp who specifically ran with this without "confirmation"?
p657
aV@richardmarx telluride is awesome.  Silverton and Ouray nearby are also wonderful
p658
aV@bethanyshondark George W Bush, not Obama, gave us Trump
p659
aV@jonfavs why did he support Hillary from Day 1?  You don't think that was a massive miscalculation?
p660
aV@politico pursue
p661
aV@bethanyshondark just out of curiosity are you opposed to the death penalty, as well?
p662
aV@chrislhayes umm prices would rise
p663
aV@JRubinBlogger @hotelkeys in what way specifically is it corrupt?
p664
aV@ritholtz @ReformedBroker incredible.  Do people actually pay Dent to invest their $?
p665
aV@scottienhughes @aguinn you gonna work in the new admin?
p666
aV@EJDionne @politico  so then why did a judge approve it?
p667
aV@LindseyGrahamSC @Evan_McMullin hey dude.  I forget.  Did you vote Trump?
p668
aV@RobGeorge @KevinBankston why is that a "wow"?
p669
aV@SethAMandel why not?
p670
aV@ananavarro @CNN 52% of republicans think he won the pop vote. Republicans are the problem Ana -- not just Trump!!
p671
aV@amandamull haven't been lately but I'm betting there's an equivalent store in the ATL airport
p672
aV@amandamull yea same w NYC metro area.  But still a trump store at EWR
p673
aV@BenSasse @sea77king obama hasn't affirmed NATO?
p674
aV@BenSasse @sea77king obama hasn't admitted Russian aggression?
p675
aV@peter_cazar @pibbsley @NateSilver538 I'd change the dem candidate, and failing that if change the Comey letter
p676
aV@peter_cazar @pibbsley @NateSilver538 it was one thing of many, which stein was saying
p677
aV@burtonad @peter_cazar @NateSilver538 @samsteinhp all he's saying is that not going to WI was one thing that hurt.  He's right.
p678
aV@peter_cazar @NateSilver538 by whom, specifically?
p679
aV@NateSilver538 who specifically has ignored that?
p680
aV@chrisinillinois @BenSasse I'm genuinely curious what specific steps Sen Sasse is advocating.
p681
aV@EamonJavers @AriFleischer #833 of US companies by market cap, to be exact.  (1,925th by sales).
p682
aV@EamonJavers @AriFleischer it's really not that complicated.  Market value of co is $4b.  (Not even in top 500 of world's companies)
p683
aV@AriFleischer umm whatever the market price is?
p684
aV@BenSasse  have you put forth any specific ideas on what Obama could have done to deter Russia further?
p685
aV@CoMBo187 @jimcramer the meat also tastes worse since they moved to the central processing kitchens
p686
aV@jonfavs @mohithreddyr it's pretty obvious why she lost -- her name is Hillary Clinton.  Any other Dem would have won so easily.
p687
aV@jonfavs we win by picking better candidates than Hillary!
p688
aV@sourcerolls @brianstelter voting D in off year elections and nominating a candidate better than Hillary in 2020
p689
aV@sourcerolls @brianstelter agree but stelter tweeting abt it every day will make 0 difference
p690
aV@brianstelter what is the point of continuing to mention this?
p691
aV@chrislhayes Actually, that's not what the article says.
p692
aV@KFILE link anywhere?  Sounds hilarious
p693
aV@benshapiro why?  Is bad judgment not a fireable offense?
p694
aV@jpodhoretz and 3 points higher than Bill Clinton in 92
p695
aV@samsteinhp @RonBrownstein 24 minutes is actually kind of a long walk
p696
aV@KFILE 100%
p697
aV@Karoli @kurteichenwald nah.  75 bps ffr is still really cheap
p698
aV@davidfrum no but he suggested it was possible as a "false flag" operation.
p699
aV@robreiner louder, Rob.  Louder!!
p700
aV@brianstelter @FoxNews  Brian, how do we know it's false if we can't see a link of what she said?
p701
aV@SopanDeb how is this excellent work?  He let her ramble on forever without answering any of his questions
p702
aV@linderje @JohnJHarwood do you have an example of the media celebrating Obama talking to Putin?
p703
aV@JohnJHarwood @davepell 46% of people who voted
p704
aV@jbarro first and third sentences also untrue...
p705
aV@SopanDeb what does "peak trump" mean?
p706
aV@CarlBialik Is this article just totally wrong?  Seems to contradict a piece you wrote on 11/15:  https://t.co/rMWRa5kHlq
p707
aV@danpfeiffer can you please provide a link or 1 or 2 examples why?  Thanks!
p708
aV@AriFleischer @davidfaber NYT reported potentially $3b but not sure abt the 4
p709
aV@SteveRattner aren't they sort of one and the same?  If he thinks BA is ripping off US I guess that counts as federal $ wasted
p710
aV@andrewrsorkin learn anything good?
p711
aV@blakehounshell it says at least so I guess it could theoretically be much more than 22m
p712
aV@blakehounshell why is that surprising?
p713
aV@kurteichenwald nytimes is saying it may be a $3B project
p714
aV@McnairJeff @EmilyMiller @BaltSunBrk yes he has zero experience with housing and urban development.  Not even remotely related experience
p715
aV@EmilyMiller @McnairJeff @BaltSunBrk so wait do you think because someone saves lives they are qualified to be HUD Secretary?
p716
aV@DavidCornDC @ABswl16 what are you talking about?  To be honest not many people know...
p717
aV@scottienhughes what is your deal?  Do you actually think Trump likes minorities?
p718
aV@JWKeady @MMFlint I hear you my friend.  Hope you're right but we both know trump is a monster
p719
aV@brianstelter dude, what's the "newsletter"?
p720
aV@JWKeady @MMFlint hey Jim.  But do you seriously think this lasts through a Trump presidency?  Zero chance!!  (And I'm no trump supporter)
p721
aV@RadioFreeTom @Joyce_Karam why is it hard for you to believe "Trump folks" are not telling the truth?
p722
aV@Toure what?
p723
aV@Krystenritter yeah but do you seriously think this will stick with Trump as president?  There is a zero percent chance (sadly).
p724
aV@sarahkendzior Aaron Friedberg is the best
p725
aV@SteveKopack yes obviously
p726
aV@jonfavs @steveweinstein 54% of people who voted
p727
aV@RadioFreeTom @KurtSchlichter @msgoddessrises  in what way is Mattis a "major gamble"?  Who in your view would be "safe" at DoD?
p728
aV@ParkerMolloy @CBSNews can you repost the actual tweet, since they took it down?
p729
aV@jimtankersley this counts as "following through"??  Not really.
p730
aV@EricLiptonNYT this is factually incorrect.  The Taiwanese Pres called Trump.  (Trump arranged)
p731
aV@scottienhughes they're distorting it?  You said it!
p732
aV@tripgabriel @hotelkeys any idea where we can see a list of the 17 agencies?
p733
aV@chrislhayes @Nate_Cohn lol
p734
aV@jbarro The Wall is such a classic candidate for this approach, too.
p735
aV@chrislhayes what do you think they are going to do with them?
p736
aV@danpfeiffer what are the mechanics of this disciplined approach?  Needs to be definitively mapped out by a leader
p737
aV@kurteichenwald why is she qualified?  Could you point me to some of her notable accomplishments as Labor Sec?
p738
aV@ScottAdamsSays so can you tell us what he's doing?
p739
aV@SopanDeb any reason this is newsworthy?
p740
aV@soledadobrien do you have any statistical data on the % of Cubans who actually supported Castro?  (Uncoerced support)
p741
aV@soledadobrien @PredatorAMP I'd like to understand...
p742
aV@amandacarpenter how do you know he isn't?
p743
aV@soledadobrien @OdalysCasas @murdochdavis @TradingBCN so was anything about him good?  I really don't get the "binary" comment.
p744
aV@chrisdonovan perhaps you could report more on that?
p745
aV@benshapiro wrong
p746
aV@mattklewis Payne stewart
p747
aV@jbarro @JenniferJJacobs @SalehaMohsin @bpolitics why?
p748
aV@Nate_Cohn @benshapiro @intelligencer aren't you the same guy who said Hillary would win NC by 6%, even after half the vote was in??  Yikes
p749
aV@SimonMaloy seems like overstatement
p750
aV@hblodget @blakehounshell a lot of people cared pre-election, which is why any democrat other than Hillary would have won.
p751
aV@pattonoswalt @Khanoisseur I guess bc 60m people would still have voted for him had they known this
p752
aV@ananavarro lol don't worry.  Senate would 100% confirm him no matter what
p753
aV@neeratanden I'd be surprised if he really cares abt this.  He is just trying to create a distraction.  Very easy to do w/Twitter!
p754
aV@JoyAnnReid @SopanDeb but is he commanding anyone?
p755
aV@JoyAnnReid but is he really "commanding" them?
p756
aV@LisaBloom not necessarily.  Depends who the litigants are
p757
aV@benshapiro the cast didn't boo him
p758
aV@ByronTau @TheRyanParker how so?
p759
aV@kurteichenwald so you're saying Pak will use nukes now?  Why would they do that?
p760
aV@jbarro wtf is this?!!
p761
aV@davidaxelrod @lowkell had obama given a news conference by this point?
p762
aV@jimtankersley @Tumultuous if that's the extent of his trade "policy", fine by me!
p763
aVRT @Shteyngart: This article NAILS IT. An important primer on kleptocratic societies and what we might have in store. https://t.co/bJxzI2Mb\u2026
p764
aV@anamariecox @brianstelter @brianphillips can you tell us who wrote it??
p765
aV@mattyglesias can't wait
p766
aV@Ingersoll007 @ScottAdamsSays correct.  Nowhere near half the country
p767
aV@ScottAdamsSays @Ingersoll007 it's inaccurate to say that half the country voted for him
p768
aV@danpfeiffer @kerpen who is Phil Kerpen?
p769
aV@KatyTurNBC @LisaBloom Katy could you please provide a legal citation?  Thanks!
p770
aV@JoyAnnReid @hotelkeys are you a reporter or an opinion pundit?
p771
aV@Olivianuzzi @ByronTau is Yglesias a news reporter, or opinion writer?  It's never been clear.
p772
aV@jbarro @MariaBartiromo did she really think that was real?  That's just awful
p773
aV@jbarro @MariaBartiromo yikes
p774
aV@Copemvn @DerekMYoung @JohnJHarwood @EliotACohen you're not making any sense
p775
aV@DerekMYoung @JohnJHarwood @EliotACohen yeah but will this matter, in any way whatsoever?
p776
aV@timkmak what law?
p777
aV@chrislhayes wouldn't they need a lot of $ in order to do so?
p778
aV@mattyglesias yeah but at least Reince (presumably) knows a bit abt how Washington works
p779
aV@soledadobrien @Noahpinion so true Soledad.  Why does he not retract his gross and incorrect statements about the accused?
p780
aV@JoyAnnReid meh.  Pretty lame
p781
aV@kerpen damn I'm not a trump supporter but that was just sad
p782
aV@jonathanchait great call!
p783
aV@PeoplesCourt79 @DebraMessing @JuddLegum get what ur saying but it in this situation hes already on the date, so we gotta hope for the best!
p784
aV@DebraMessing @JuddLegum so you're not gonna give him a chance Debra?
p785
aV@amyfiscus @latimes seems like a reasonable question actually
p786
aV@nickgourevitch @jbarro bill Clinton was much less popular in 92
p787
aV@chrislhayes @DianaCialino how so?  Have you ever wondered if you are overstating things?
p788
aV@KatrinaNation huh?
p789
aV@pattonoswalt @NikkiGlaser @BroderickGreer why not give him a chance Patton?
p790
aV@narents @Nate_Cohn Or why they predicted Hillary winning NC by 6 points -- even after half the votes were already in...
p791
aV@chrislhayes but when have we not been geographically polarized?
p792
aV@Nate_Cohn and this was after &gt;50% of the votes were already in!
p793
aV@Nate_Cohn can you explain how you guys got the NC results so wrong?  You were consistently predicting a convincing Hillary win
p794
aV@ReformedBroker someone who mentions their net worth over lunch doesn't seem very likable to me...
p795
aVRT @realDonaldTrump: The electoral college is a disaster for a democracy.
p796
aV@jbarro depends when that cataclysm is expected
p797
aV@DebraMessing @monicasloves where is that?
p798
aV@AriMelber @oesmom1 this is still incorrect.  52% of voters, not 52% of US.  Massively different #s.
p799
aV@chrislhayes genuinely curious (and not a trump supporter), asking what exactly are they hoping to achieve?
p800
aV@MaxBoot Max many of us would love to see you serve!
p801
aV@Toure Nope.  Just 52% of the small fraction who voted.
p802
aV@AriMelber 52% of eligible voters, not 52% of US.
p803
aV@mattyglesias George Clooney?  The Rock?
p804
aV@EricBoehlert @narents @GeraldFSeib @WSJ well said
p805
aV@RiskReversal @templeofthedog @ReformedBroker I just wish more people were holding up cell phone cameras
p806
aV@ReformedBroker @periscopeco temple of the dog??
p807
aV@StephensWSJ the right has been discounting nuclear risk in support of (maybe?) lower taxes.  It doesn't make any sense.
p808
aV@Timodc @LarrySabato @anamariecox @Lawrence guarantee he breaks 200 EVs.  Guarantee.

aV@TheFix @Spotify Testify by Rage against the machine
p812
aV@scottienhughes what's your Electoral Vote prediction for election night?
p813
aV@Redistrict I think he hits 5-6%
p814
aV@jonfavs so are you saying Ryan actually thinks he will win?
p815
aV@senatorshoshana how so?
p816
aV@DaveBrayUSA he called our military leaders "losers" yesterday.  Do you agree?
p817
aV@powellnyt @NoceraNYT no I totally agree with you on that.  I've been terribly disappointed with his interviews and whole campaign
p818
aV@powellnyt @NoceraNYT true.  What seems most impt to me is a willingness to learn.  Notably missing from a certain R candidate.
p819
aV@powellnyt @NoceraNYT especially since I'd be surprised if Trump knows what Istanbul is, much less Aleppo
p820
aV@powellnyt @NoceraNYT I would never vote for Johnson but thought the Aleppo thing was overblown
p821
aV@powellnyt @NoceraNYT I agree it's preferable to know it but just think those "gotcha" questions can be learned very quickly
p822
aV@NoceraNYT @powellnyt @nntaleb @Medium agree with Taleb here.  Can't a leader just Google Aleppo?
p823
aV@heytana hi Tana!  What are your thoughts on the arrests from your transition chair's team?
p824
aV@ninatypewriter nah.  Costs $ to get from city to city.  He may just run for speaker of the house.
p825
aV@ConservCityGirl @johnhawkinsrwn what is this supposed to teach us?
p826
aV@gehrig38 @garylporter @SethDavisHoops @nickgourevitch what don't you get about trump disrespecting numerous religions and races?
p827
aV@TheClaudiaWells @BacktotheFuture @BibiMccandless This is awesome!!
p828
aV@puppymnkey @rudygiulianiGOP I dont think that's his real acct
p829
aV@tonyschwartz you may mean Stuart Stevens
p830
aV@Convertbond how many people have retired?
p831
aV@samsteinhp wouldn't the most recent one be more relevant?
p832
aV@TheClaudiaWells incredible!  (Except they won in 7;)
p833
aV@ochocinco why not?
p834
aV@ochocinco they aren't anymore??
p835
aV@brianbeutler @samsteinhp amazing (?) humble brag
p836
aV@libbyanelson tweet of the night!
p837
aV@kasie what polls are you referring to?
p838
aV@peyton_darnelll @benshapiro who is Ben Shapiro?
p839
aV@MacMargi believe whatever you want.  Zero chance she wins FL.  (Ps not a trump supporter)
p840
aV@MacMargi @jheil nah this means absolutely nothing sadly
p841
aV@MacMargi Nate Silver just turned FL red.  It's over
p842
aV@larry_kudlow well if it happens Trump wins.  Starting to think he loses popular but wins electoral.
p843
aV@chrislhayes yup.  Ps Fox News just moved NC blue for some reason
p844
aV@MacMargi @Lawrence ps I'm not a Trump supporter
p845
aV@MacMargi @Lawrence yeah but if the early vote is what you say, that's physically impossible
p846
aV@DebraMessing what do you think of the latest FBI stuff?
p847
aV@McFaul why do they even have those 2?
p848
aV@larry_kudlow  come on Larry.  Think he'll win CO?
p849
aV@JohnJHarwood this is so stupid.  So he is saying vote for me, but if not vote for Hillary.  That still negatively affects Hillary big time
p850
aV@MacMargi @JoeNBC yikes.  You may want to read up on past elections.
p851
aV@MacMargi @JoeNBC I get it but the remainder of voters will be heavily R, same as late voters in every past election.
p852
aV@MacMargi @JoeNBC 53% of the early vote for the Dem more or less guarantees a FL loss
p853
aV@MacMargi @JoeNBC umm that's like nothing.
p854
aV@StacyLeMelle @PaulBegala @Lawrence so??
p855
aV@jmartNYT @tbonier @Lawrence @_TargetSmart meaning what???
p856
aV@sebastianbach @BreadyScott did you figure out that iTunes thing??  Sounds like bullshit by iTunes!
p857
aV@chrislhayes by whom?
p858
aV@JustinPulitzer I'm thinking we may see Hillary win the popular vote and Trump win electoral
p859
aV@JustinPulitzer what's your election prediction?
p860
aV@EmilyMiller especially the ones not including 3rd parties
p861
aV@AriMelber this is not correct according to Richard Painter, the former chief WH ethics lawyer (see nytimes piece)
p862
aV@Redistrict could something weird happen in WI?
p863
aV@samsteinhp he's advocated that probably over a hundred times during this campaign.
p864
aV@stuartpstevens wouldn't 3x the population be 990m?
p865
aV@christinawilkie Oh, it will, like every single other thing he says.
p866
aV@mattyglesias And, what does it mean that they "may be" tied?
p867
aV@KeithOlbermann @joshrogin @BretBaier @FoxNewsSunday Keith do you have a legal citation for this assertion?
p868
aV@nytimes why does Thiel keep talking about "half the country"?  Among likely voters (40% of the population), Trump garners 42-45% support.
p869
aV@bmaz @mviser presumably they have to review them for classification which is a lengthy process requiring the state department
p870
aV@ThePlumLineGS @allinwithchris yeah but I they can search this in a couple minutes
p871
aV@kayleighmcenany have you looked at any other forecasts?
p872
aV@ProfJeffJarviss huh?   Where is that quote?
p873
aV@SethDavisHoops yikes
p874
aV@linderje @kurteichenwald @jaketapper but he would have carefully followed the law I'm sure.  Btw what has Wikileaks found in his emails?
p875
aV@AriMelber @swcreates any explanation of why it apparently took 5 weeks to determine that Hillary emails existed on Weiner's computer?
p876
aV@linderje @kurteichenwald @jaketapper Hey John what kind of servers did Trump use?
p877
aV@brianstelter whoa.  So it's untrue that it "went to republican members of the house"?
p878
aV@jpodhoretz @ThePlumLineGS @maddow you can check dupes in a few minutes.  Weird.
p879
aV@jpodhoretz she said she would, and she did in 2008.  Why wouldn't she?
p880
aV@ChrisMegerian really?  He graduated college in 2000 according to his LinkedIn
p881
aV@mattmfm @HillAdvocate @politico could actually be a semi-insightful comment if we knew where he's talking abt
p882
aV@matthewjdowd now it's at +4.  A 66% decrease in her lead in a week seems significant
p883
aV@pinkbunny70  sadly he's right.  She's lost her lead in OH and FL
p884
aV@ChrisCuomo nice job Chris but it cuts off once the Obamacare stuff starts.  Would love to see that part!
p885
aV@TheStalwart what is she even talking about?  To whom is she submitting the "petition"?
p886
aV@tonyschwartz did you see the NV/FL polls today?  Very concerning
p887
aV@bmaz @dangillmor national media is abandoning everything!  When was the last time we heard abt Judge Curiel???
p888
aV@David_MAFS where are the live tweets??
p889
aV@RachelDeAlto how did you make the move from law to TV??  Would love to hear more!!
p890
aV@pattonoswalt @CurtisHouck dude.  Why does Newt keep tilting his head?  He looks like my dog when I offer him a squeaky toy.
p891
aV@JonahNRO @marieann66 @BlakeConklin @redsteeze @davidharsanyi so by rooting for Dems to fail, are you hoping Trump wins?
p892
aV@jpodhoretz why is Newt rotating his head during most of that clip?  My dog does that when I offer him a squeaky toy
p893
aV@David_MAFS @Tres_MAFS @Neil_MAFS where can we find the live tweet?  Also what are the ratings for this thing?
p894
aV@JWKeady @AriBerman @thenation hey man who are you voting for for Pres?
p895
aV@Neil_MAFS @Tres_MAFS @David_MAFS where can we find the live tweet?
p896
aV@SethMacFarlane @Noahpinion how about 08-09 and 14-16?
p897
aV@MDJD2 @JRubinBlogger nope:  https://t.co/a5ObUCthg6
p898
aV@MDJD2 @JRubinBlogger we have something called the electoral college and Trump is losing NC/FL/OH/AZ/NV/PA/NH/ME.  Let me guess, all wrong?
p899
aV@JRubinBlogger Kernan had absolutely no idea what he was talking about.  The current US polls are nowhere near as close as Brexit polls were
p900
aV@Olivianuzzi link?
p901
aV@scottienhughes why is Trump's staff so small?
p902
aV@scottienhughes @AC360 @CNN no chance at all
p903
aV@mattyglesias ?
p904
aV@Patrickesque @PeteDogg79 @hoodsonco She may be wrong but she's never in doubt.  Very Trumpian figure.
p905
aV@mattyglesias weird that trump would ever say something odd
p906
aV@stuartpstevens @jpodhoretz  hard to see how any personal agendas are being advanced, since trump hotel bookings are down ~50%.
p907
aV@LouDobbs it's not rigged.  Such an irresponsible assertion.
p908
aV@NicoleAuerbach @pattonoswalt somewhere far, far away from wrigley

aV@Evan_McMullin who do you suggest be in charge of conservation areas?  Private parties?  Doesn't seem like it would work very well
p910
aV@ValaAfshar Lyft

aV@Bencjacobs @KFaulders neither is PA
p912
aV@bmaz @DrJillStein @EpochTimes what in the hell is she even talking about?
p913
aV@jpodhoretz @stanveuger @seanhannity @HillaryClinton and don't forget, Hannity also speaks for abt 50% of the R party.
p914
aV@secupp @APolasek lol tartabull.  What abt Roberto Kelly??
p915
aV@ishapiro @charlescwcooke btw McMullin just got certified as a write-in in NY
p916
aV@ishapiro @charlescwcooke right so who?
p917
aV@charlescwcooke @ishapiro who are you voting for?
p918
aV@billyeichner who?
p919
aV@kayleighmcenany what the hell are you even talking about?
p920
aV@stuartpstevens are you assuming Hannity is capable of rational thought?
p921
aV@pattonoswalt  what a disgusting moron
p922
aV@joshrogin @jaketapper @TheLeadCNN anyone have a link?
p923
aV@SamWangPhD maybe this pushes Hill up to 100% in your model? ;)
p924
aV@owillis @inklake I don't think so.  40% of the R party was for trump no matter what.
p925
aV@jonfavs @Phil_Mattingly she absolutely dominated him.  It was like watching Michigan football play a high school team.
p926
aV@linderje @jpodhoretz dude are you still supporting trump despite his racism?
p927
aV@chuckwoolery come on Chuck.....
p928
aV@gehrig38 hey man.  So is trump gonna win this or what??
p929
aV@ReformedBroker hilarious and where do you find this shit
p930
aV@kurteichenwald Hillary wins, obviously.  Right?  Right??????
p931
aV@jonlovett @oliverdarcy @bi_politics you really think it would have mattered?  40% of the party was for Trump no matter what
p932
aV@DB756 @gehrig38 I think he will lose
p933
aV@ReformedBroker @Noahpinion so stupid to keep mentioning Chicago and Detroit.  Does he even know how the electoral college works?
p934
aV@gehrig38 you really think Trump will win?
p935
aV@bmaz check out his periscope if you ever want entertainment.  Nonsensical rants on a nightly basis
p936
aV@bmaz this is gonna be good.  Warren must be celebrating
p937
aV@chrislhayes @DougHenwood it's basically over
p938
aV@ezraklein why are you confident in that?
p939
aV@alexburnsNYT @JenniferJJacobs same w WI last night
p940
aV@soledadobrien Hillary winning in latest GA poll, and tied in AK.  Remarkable.
p941
aV@ReformedBroker alarmed
p942
aV@jpodhoretz what channel?
p943
aV@OliverWest100 @Bencjacobs all correct
p944
aV@Austan_Goolsbee under by a hair
p945
aV@Bencjacobs I assume the follow up q was abt Broaddrick, who denied anything happened when she was under oath?
p946
aV@jonfavs media seems obsessed w/making this a horse race
p947
aV@jonfavs I'm not sure he's ever stuck to a topic for 60 seconds
p948
aV@EmilyMiller do you have a link to this?
p949
aV@KatyTurNBC what did you tell him?
p950
aV@ReformedBroker Eric's Safari -- LOL
p951
aV@KattyKayBBC @Morning_Joe yeah but check out Alaska
p952
aV@mcuban @ABswl16 @UberFacts how does anyone know his exact # of employees?
p953
aV@SallyAlbright it's "mcMullin"
p954
aV@chavezlinda Linda this is awesome!!
p955
aV@bmaz I'm sure, although Rudy is tough to watch these days
p956
aV@bmaz @jaketapper Thanks I'll check it out
p957
aV@Nate_Cohn what do you mean?  He is still supporting a candidate who is losing badly.
p958
aV@kayleighmcenany LOL.  And the other half?
p959
aV@bmaz @jaketapper is there a link to this anywhere?
p960
aV@cabaum1 it's a parody account
p961
aV@bmaz @KagroX not that I know of
p962
aV@bmaz @KagroX https://t.co/BOTwCQ4QKB
p963
aV@bmaz @KagroX yeah I think Zervos acknowledged his existence
p964
aV@awzurcher @KattyKayBBC have you or has anyone else verified that "John Barry" is indeed a real person?
p965
aV@murphymike I agree but hasn't he been doing this for over a year now?
p966
aV@Redistrict Ryan is the trump wing
p967
aV@shannonrwatts  they won't say anything bc they absolutely love Trump
p968
aV@thehill has it been independently verified that this is in fact her cousin?  Trump used to falsify his identity as "John Barron".
p969
aV@christinawilkie why not ask Summer herself?
p970
aV@SheWhoVotes @bannerite do you really think it would have made a difference?  He still has 85% republican support!
p971
aV@stutteringjohnm @AnnCoulter of course she is!  John are you serious?
p972
aV@NateWatkins @kayleighmcenany do you actually expect her to answer logically to this?
p973
aV@nylitgirl @KattyKayBBC ha!  Is there a link for this?
p974
aV@chrislhayes the media reporting any of this a year ago would have made zero difference.  Trump would have still won the nom.
p975
aV@GideonResnick how so?
p976
aV@JohnDingell @costareports hahaha!
p977
aV@nylitgirl yup.  Just wonder where he'll get the $ to pay them.
p978
aV@jmartNYT what did he say?
p979
aV@bmaz @TVietor08 @Tom_Winter how did winter "clean it up"?
p980
aV@bmaz @TVietor08 @Tom_Winter so weird.  How is this a news story?!!
p981
aV@Nate_Cohn no she isn't.  She was silent for 30 hrs following the biggest disaster of his campaign
p982
aV@DonaldJTrumpJr how about fact checking your dad's sex tape comments?
p983
aV@kasie @PhilipRucker have you asked her?
p984
aVRT @Lawrence: Please retweet if not one word you heard @realDonaldTrump say on the Access Hollywood bus surprised you. Not one word.
p985
aV@awprokop Thanks.  Any idea where we can see a running list?
p986
aV@RobertGBeckel wtf???
p987
aV@gehrig38 you ok with his disgusting comments about grabbing p---y?
p988
aV@gehrig38 come on Curt
p989
aV@jpodhoretz oh come on.  Wasn't just them.
p990
aV@jamisonfoser don't worry, none will!
p991
aV@JenniferJJacobs @dgjackson  how can this happen when early votes have already been cast?
p992
aV@RebeccaJarvis wow
p993
aV@jonfavs @Nate_Cohn @danpfeiffer @davidplouffe why is Gallup bad?
p994
aV@John_Castelli @GovBillWeld there's an nytimes article on the site
p995
aV@John_Castelli @GovBillWeld He implied that our accidental bombings were the moral equivalent of the Syrian government's actions.  Horrible.
p996
aV@GovBillWeld today he said that the US is no better than the government of Syria.  Come on Bill, this is disgraceful stuff.
p997
aV@MarlowNYC @tristanwalker taxes don't indicate net worth
p998
aV@pattonoswalt @secupp I don't think it was douchey at all.  R is basically running Aleppo and Trump's in debt to R.  Highly relevant.
p999
aV@johnastoehr @Karoli @secupp yeah this is really weird.  What is she talking about?
p1000
aV@KFILE assuming this is sarcastic
p1001
aV@Evan_McMullin @JoyAnnReid @rumpfshaker Good luck Evan!  Are you on the ballot in NY?
p1002
aV@chrislhayes although Trump got only &lt;50% of GOP primary vote
p1003
aV@mattyglesias lol
p1004
aV@gehrig38 do you think Trump is a good businessman?  How do you explain his horrendous casino performance in the 1990s?
p1005
aV@scottienhughes why would evangelicals ever vote for trump?  Which values does he share with them, specifically?
p1006
aV@scottienhughes  what did you think of the NYT report on Trump's tax return?
p1007
aV@soledadobrien @Mikel_Jollett @white_feminist @RonaldChapman1 https://t.co/rM7IPmwefI
p1008
aV@soledadobrien @Mikel_Jollett @white_feminist @RonaldChapman1 this isn't accurate as recently there have been signs of income gains
p1009
aV@ReformedBroker @TheStalwart or a bagel
p1010
aV@RichLowry @memeorandum how can we see "he didn't mean it in this way"?  Please elaborate!
p1011
aV@hblodget @StephensWSJ  it's his personal return.  Yes paper losses but still his.
p1012
aV@TVietor08 @ditzkoff never seen an angrier comedian
p1013
aV@LeahTiscione huh
p1014
aV@gehrig38 if only she was as articulate as Trump
p1015
aV@jonfavs someone should really ask him who the PM of France or GB is.  Guarantee he has no idea.
p1016
aV@scottienhughes are you still supporting trump even after that debate performance?
p1017
aV@mcuban  well said sir!
p1018
aV@ninjawoodworker @BPCoughlin @hughhewitt that's a separate issue
p1019
aV@BPCoughlin @hughhewitt jobs that exist in furtherance of a money-losing enterprise
p1020
aV@hughhewitt this is so silly.  A good economist would say that providing entertainment via speech is better than creating money-losing jobs
p1021
aV@jonfavs @anamariecox how do you know?
p1022
aV@gehrig38 hey man who won that debate?
p1023
aV@elliegoulding @GlblCtzn did you guys play for free?
p1024
aV@GlennKesslerWP @SopanDeb  weird, trump got a fact wrong?
p1025
aV@ABCLiz weird, Trump got a fact wrong?  No way.
p1026
aV@christinawilkie what a dumb tweet.  Especially considering he did the same thing in LA for the floods
p1027
aV@AlexisinNH why are you still supporting him?!
p1028
aV@belindaofficial what about it?
p1029
aV@nickgillespie nick are you still supporting Gary Johnson even though you are helping Trump by doing so?
p1030
aVNot anyone's
p1031
aV@DaveMustaine @WelbertCampos no Morello?
p1032
aV@dylanmatt is this supposed to be journalism or an opinion piece?
p1033
aV@Sam_MAFS @Neil_MAFS what do you think of the new season???
p1034
aV@AlexisinNH what's your point
p1035
aV@MistyMayTreanor who are you voting for?
p1036
aV@PatrickRuffini you're just casually adding WI?!  LOL!!!
p1037
aV@carlywaddell @ebassclinics are u guys in Nashville??
p1038
aV@gehrig38 @SuperScottyO nah she's done much more
p1039
aV@gehrig38 @SuperScottyO how do you explain the multiple bankruptcies?
p1040
aV@gehrig38 @BSmegg p.s.  What are your thoughts on Trump's appearance with Don King today?
p1041
aV@gehrig38 @BSmegg and what exactly have I said that's the "dose of dumb"?
p1042
aV@gehrig38 @BSmegg LOL.  Yup, the 4 biggest ones.  Competence!!
p1043
aV@jpodhoretz @EvanStreusand anyone have any idea why trump isn't being investigated for the charity stuff?  Seems like it's clearly illegal
p1044
aV@gehrig38 @BSmegg what's worse -- community organizer or "billionaire" rich kid who has gone bankrupt 4 times?
p1045
aV@AlexisinNH what are your thoughts on Don King?
p1046
aVRT @baratunde: By "interviewed" he means "fellated." https://t.co/XkrLuJMeU5
p1047
aV@gehrig38 or was it 4?  I forget!  Great businessman though, right?
p1048
aV@gehrig38 what has trump done again?  Gone bankrupt 3 times?
p1049
aV@mcuban but if you can borrow incredibly cheaply for productive infrastructure projects, why not do it?  (P.s. Not a trump fan, just asking)
p1050
aVRT @LHSummers: I am as worried about the debt burden on my children\u2019s generation as anybody... 1/2 https://t.co/MJ9j1AlsjY
p1051
aV@benjaminwittes Nate Silver currently has Trump at 44.5% likelihood of winning the election.  Yikes.
p1052
aV@benjaminwittes This is problematic for Hillary.  If she can't hold Colorado it will be very difficult for her to win...
p1053
aV@benjaminwittes btw it's not true that Trump has only led in one CO poll: \u000ahttps://t.co/ikTHAd4cJ3
p1054
aV@stuartpstevens @cenkuygur why are the Dems not in a state of complete panic about this?  She has steadily lost ground over the past 3 weeks
p1055
aV@stuartpstevens @cenkuygur trump is up to 44.5% odds in silver's model.  He's at around 80% in Sam Wang's model but rising quickly.
p1056
aV@The_Real_Rage @Kasparov63 So what does Garry expect?  Obama should reason with these clowns??!  It's impossible
p1057
aV@Kasparov63 also, how was the Merrick Garland pick "unilateral"?  He is a centrist
p1058
aV@Kasparov63 what would you prefer?  Obama try to reason with the Tea Party?  They don't believe in science.  How can he reason with them??
p1059
aV@tmorello Tom, you do realize Stein's candidacy is directly helping Trump, right?
p1060
aV@benjaminwittes I hope you're right but I'm worried abt CO/NH/ME.  To lesser extent, MI/WI.  Momentum not going in the right direction
p1061
aV@benjaminwittes But wasn't he winning the latest CO polls?
p1062
aV@ReformedBroker trump has zero chance at winning NY.  He may well win the election however.
p1063
aV@AlexisinNH @gdebenedetti he's exactly right, as usual.
p1064
aV@soledadobrien @oliverdarcy incredible that it's the commissioner's first day on the job
p1065
aV@soledadobrien @ImmersiveeKevin @alisonkingNECN @sethporges glad you got there ok!  Also 7th totally closed near Penn Station
p1066
aV@soledadobrien @ImmersiveeKevin @alisonkingNECN @sethporges also the 1/2/3 subway line shut down below 34th in Manhattan
p1067
aV@soledadobrien @ImmersiveeKevin @alisonkingNECN @sethporges I live 8 blocks away and traffic is horrendous
p1068
aV@AriFleischer @MatthewNussbaum so Ari, if a candidate tells a lie, should the media correct it or just report what he/she said?
p1069
aV@BuzzFeedAndrew let me guess -- the interviewer just let him ramble rather than fact checking him?
p1070
aV@davidfrum not sure whether to laugh or cry...
p1071
aV@WillieGeist @davidplouffe @chucktodd lol
p1072
aV@scottienhughes do you view David duke as deplorable, or do you agree with Pence?
p1073
aV@stuartpstevens @ijbailey I think slow and steady is fine for most people w/market near record high and massive job add streak ongoing
p1074
aV@danpfeiffer does politico actually pay people to create this stuff?  Fascinating business model.
p1075
aV@RealJamesWoods @jjauthor @Pamela_Moore13 of what, exactly?
p1076
aV@mattyglesias @JohnJHarwood @CNBC why was it so difficult for the CNBC anchors to press him on this point??  They just let him ramble.
p1077
aV@davidfrum can you give an example or two based on past evidence that she is "less susceptible to bad ideas" than Obama?
p1078
aV@toddstarnes Mike pence too?
p1079
aV@AlexaShrugged @instapundit umm overheated, as her campaign said
p1080
aV@pbump @ThisWeekABC wow he's really lost it.  So sad to watch this
p1081
aV@JoseCanseco no
p1082
aV@mcuban haha nice...keep Em coming!!
p1083
aV@scottienhughes  so you disagree with Trump that CNN is an embarrassment to broadcast news.  I see.
p1084
aV@gehrig38 @stewmatic you do realize Trump uses a TelePrompTer daily, correct?
p1085
aV@gehrig38 @arthutchinson2 @Periscope they sound like awesome jobs
p1086
aV@anamariecox have you ever watched his old Stern interviews?  Shockingly he seemed pretty likable
p1087
aV@gehrig38 Trump just promised to "shoot Iranian ships" if they make a rude gesture.  Good idea?
p1088
aV@AmyMek by that logic why should we care about anything Trump's ever thought?  He's always been a private citizen.
p1089
aV@hughhewitt @maysoonzayid unclear how he is advancing their "national interests" at all.  In fact they are going in the opposite direction
p1090
aV@hughhewitt @maysoonzayid Can you name some great Russian companies that have started under Putin?  What abt great Russian universities?
p1091
aV@hughhewitt @maysoonzayid in what way is Putin "eating our lunch"?  Have you checked any of their economic stats lately?
p1092
aV@hughhewitt Hugh -- in what was has Putin "served his country's national interest"?  Please provide 3 specific examples...
p1093
aV@stuartpstevens @KurtSchlichter @FeliciaBGomez hey man you still think Trump has no chance?
p1094
aV@gdebenedetti @timkaine damn I would have gone!
p1095
aV@TheJanelleShow yo.  Will last internationale play NYC soon or what???!!!
p1096
aV@jimcramer @FredBuford great.  I will definitely spread the word and my wife and I both appreciate your positive words!!
p1097
aV@brianstelter @realDonaldTrump yeah dude but why is he winning by so much in it?  Ever think@of analyzing that??
p1098
aV@JDiamond1 Miller is such a loser.  What is he even taking about?
p1099
aV@KatrinaNation @megynkelly she is such a joke.  Why can't any fox anchor press trump on any issue?
p1100
aV@jimcramer @FredBuford the doc was so awesome.  As a resident of the neighborhood my wife and I loved it!!
p1101
aV@ishapiro @JimmyLaSalvia @GOP then vote for Evan Mcmullin.
p1102
aV@Nedjo_Vukanovic @RealAlexJones so why is Jones making an issue out of this?  Seems so stupid
p1103
aV@AlexisinNH @HillaryClinton hey Alexis!  How are you?  Are you an Alex Jones fan?
p1104
aV@RealAlexJones doesn't every motorcade have an ambulance?
p1105
aV@realDonaldTrump thanks Donald.  Can you give more details about the veteran who said she should be in jail?  I am unfamiliar.
p1106
aV@jonfavs @anneapplebaum can you do anything?  Go work for Hillary maybe???
p1107
aV@jonfavs where the hell is Palin anyway?  Seems like Trump shut her out of the convention
p1108
aV@Acosta there should be no "relitigating".  The fact is there is nothing in the public record indicating his objection to it when it started
p1109
aV@BillKristol huh?
p1110
aV@AlexisinNH sounds like a great idea.  The Dems are hoping he does too!  Great use of time.
p1111
aV@NateWatkins @GovGaryJohnson Totally.  Someone should ask Trump to name the leaders of Great Britain and France.  Guarantee he can't.
p1112
aV@politico @DianaCialino then NBC posted a fact check which contained embarrassing wrong info and still does.  Iraq war did not start in 1/03
p1113
aV@GlennKesslerWP @joshtpm @MLauer @NBCNews even the fact check is wrong.  The Iraq War did not start in Jan 2003 like it states.
p1114
aV@mcuban @FrankLuntz his nonsensical lie about opposing the war needs to be corrected!
p1115
aV@mcuban @FrankLuntz Mark, perhaps you could use your platform to alert people that Trump actually supported the Iraq war?
p1116
aV@davidfrum LOL.  Gee I guess Trump will win California.
p1117
aV@NBCNews any chance you could correct the Iraq War start date in this tweet?  It's incorrect but highly relevant to the Trump timeline
p1118
aV@DrJillStein @jchaltiwanger he's a disgrace.  Do you realize you are helping him in this election?
p1119
aV@jonfavs or imagine another candidate saying "I love war" or "wages are too high"
p1120
aV@jonfavs imagine another candidate saying he opposed a war that he supported
p1121
aV@sweetatertot2 @jasian12345 when in 2003 exactly?
p1122
aV@NBCNews this gets the start date of the war wrong!!  It wasn't January 2003, it was March.  Come on guys get it together please!
p1123
aV@mattyglesias @pinkbunny70 @MLauer @NBCNews even the fact check is wrong!  It says the Iraq war started in January 2003, which is incorrect!
p1124
aV@NickKristof just a flat out moron.  Who may win!?!
p1125
aV@tonyschwartz @ninatypewriter you mean along with 19 other things?
p1126
aV@LoganLevkoff it was brutal!
p1127
aV@Ruth_Red_27 @seanhannity @JonahNRO never assumed anything
p1128
aV@Ruth_Red_27 @seanhannity @JonahNRO so we were safe in 2000 and early 2001?
p1129
aV@Ruth_Red_27 @seanhannity @JonahNRO what concerns me are a lot of things, including low information voters
p1130
aV@Ruth_Red_27 @seanhannity @JonahNRO you said "safe again".  Still waiting on what year you mean.
p1131
aV@JonahNRO @seanhannity hasn't trump said repeatedly that "wages are too high?"
p1132
aV@ClintRoughton @seanhannity @JonahNRO if "no one wants to loan money at such a weak profit", why are 10-yr T bills near record low yields?
p1133
aV@Ruth_Red_27 @seanhannity @JonahNRO when was our country safe exactly?  What year?
p1134
aV@Ruth_Red_27 @seanhannity @JonahNRO so are you saying refugees contribute nothing?  They don't work?
p1135
aV@ClintRoughton @seanhannity @JonahNRO rates have been low for a decade and will remain low for the forseeable future
p1136
aV@ClintRoughton @seanhannity @JonahNRO why not borrow more while rates are at record low?  Demand for treasuries is off the charts
p1137
aV@seanhannity @JonahNRO what's wrong with "wanting refugees"?  Could you provide data showing refugees in the US are a net negative?
p1138
aV@seanhannity @JonahNRO logical response:  preventing one outcome does not equal a preferable outcome
p1139
aV@seanhannity @JonahNRO meaning it's ok for one more guy to break promises?
p1140
aV@jonfavs what a joke
p1141
aV@realjeffreyross @jimmycarr those coulter jokes were unreal
p1142
aV@AlexisinNH any problems with him banning the wash post?
p1143
aV@jayhup @AlexisinNH I know.  He's a total madman
p1144
aV@AlexisinNH only thing that reads like the Onion are trumps claims he's gonna punish the press as president and his ban of the Wash post
p1145
aV@mattyglesias Moreso than Alex Jones??
p1146
aV@NateSilver538 is it not an accurate citation?
p1147
aV@thehill I think there's a fake tweet in here from a parody account which is incorrectly attributed to Trump...
p1148
aV@SopanDeb does writing about this every day actually make any difference?
p1149
aV@TMZ where does he say he supports kapernick's protest?  I just watched the clip and saw nothing even close...
p1150
aV@linderje @TheFix does Trump know what it means?
p1151
aV@drewmagary ever check Shill's periscope?  It's something special
p1152
aV@mcuban Howard Stern is pro Hillary and has an absolutely massive audience
p1153
aV@mcuban @DavidHofstetter I think Howard Stern is pro Hillary
p1154
aV@bill_easterly and the fact that Trump is winning several national polls means nothing?
p1155
aV@gehrig38 could you explain why, exactly?
p1156
aV@mcuban @amandacarpenter does Amanda have any response to this point?
p1157
aV@JohnJHarwood Not true, considering these squabbles have been ongoing yet he is tied or winning multiple national polls.
p1158
aV@JustinPulitzer @jimcramer hell yes!  Absolutely great documentary.
p1159
aV@karaswisher maybe even worse than Meh.  That was pretty bad.
p1160
aVRT @Madonna: How Big of. Pussy Do you have to BE to kill this Noble Animal for sport? Just ask Donald...https://t.co/TjNYZTW6Xb https://t.c\u2026

aV@bannerite @DebraMessing @dmartosko so make a mistake and move on.  It's the scared campaigning that no one likes.
p1162
aV@DebraMessing @dmartosko but why not hold a press conference?
p1163
aV@ryanstruyk link to poll?
p1164
aV@stuartpstevens @tonyschwartz but I'll be damned, it's working.  Winning USC poll with abt 5% of the ground game as Hill.
p1165
aV@BillKristol @SRuhle why is it a change election with an economy at full employment and the stock market near record high?
p1166
aV@drumgal95 it's horrible!
p1167
aV@nickgillespie @lordaedonis this is not an endorsement
p1168
aV@ryangrim what were the 2 misspellings?
p1169
aV@ananavarro he is an idiot for exercising his right of free speech?  Weird
p1170
aV@NYTnickc @thegarance aren't all illegal immigrants criminals by definition?  What does he say about this?
p1171
aV@DrJillStein @TheLibRepublic @GovGaryJohnson you're actually not taking many votes from anyone.  Aren't you around 1-2% in most polls?
p1172
aV@RichBTIG @barronsonline congrats!
p1173
aV@AlexisinNH Except for Donald Trump and his entire family.
p1174
aV@DrJillStein what does being a feminist have to do with this?
p1175
aV@IngrahamAngle @nytimes @jwpetersNYT does "at it" mean reporting the facts?
p1176
aV@DonnyFerguson @KenGardner11 and because Trump voters don't care about issues for some reason.
p1177
aV@JohnStossel not sure if that's the one near Penn Station but I actually had a seamless experience there last year.  15 mins total.
p1178
aV@mattyglesias GDP is not a factor in setting rates.  Inflation/Unemployment all that matters.
p1179
aV@PrisonPlanet I am curious what their response is to your assertion they never reached out to you.  Have they responded yet?
p1180
aV@Evan_McMullin I'm interested but would love to know what state this is for?
p1181
aV@maggieNYT that's really useful info
p1182
aV@SopanDeb weird that he leaves out that the Great Wall took 17 centuries to build...
p1183
aV@jonfortt @SopanDeb seems like he's literally stopped speaking in coherent sentences
p1184
aV@MaxBoot yes and he has a firehose strategy of saying so much stuff it all blends together, however outrageous.  He diversifies his risk.
p1185
aV@MaxBoot @SopanDeb I don't think the content of Trump's "message" matters anymore.  He is climbing in the polls based on his persona.
p1186
aV@rkylesmith @SopanDeb what the hell is he even talking about?
p1187
aV@HelenHunt where is that?
p1188
aV@davidfrum @davidfolkenflik nope plenty of factual evidence re Rudy
p1189
aV@ChrisCuomo @MoeBriggs why not pin him down on a specific year America was great?  Like, don't continue the interview until he answers...
p1190
aV@Ricky_Vaughn99 what is your evidence that PPP is more accurate?
p1191
aV@Karoli @DebraMessing stein seems totally out of her mind
p1192
aV@KVanValkenburg @stuartpstevens for a campaign that places no value on facts perhaps she is perfect?
p1193
aV@DrJillStein I think we believe they do, but also believe that we need to vote for a madman's opponent.  Sound fair Jill?
p1194
aV@MacMargi @DrJillStein haha right just so angry abt the world.  Until they stop talking politics and go back to their affluent lives
p1195
aV@TheRickWilson @MikeyDavidoff agree, trump is a total weakling
p1196
aV@MacMargi @DrJillStein god she is so weird and crazy
p1197
aV@DrJillStein when have they caused harm to people in the US again?
p1198
aV@linderje @secupp John, in what way is the press unfair to Trump?  (I assume you are familiar with his statement that any publicity is good)
p1199
aV@AlexisinNH why not add Donald Trump???
p1200
aV@TheRickWilson totally true
p1201
aV@AmbassadorPower @Nationals from the mound no less!  Nice job!!
p1202
aV@Jamie1947 @jbarro @mattyglesias sometimes I also think trump supporters are just bored and want to watch an entertaining guy on TV
p1203
aV@nylitgirl where did you see that Halperin supports Trump?
p1204
aV@fgsweetdog @larry_kudlow I wish Larry would respond to my point abt Ryan admitting Trump makes racist statements.  Instead Larry ignores.
p1205
aV@ThatCoral well said
p1206
aV@stuartpstevens @ByronYork how about when he said "wages are too high", denied it, then ripped Clinton for saying coal mines would shut??
p1207
aV@LP6801 @larry_kudlow Thanks for posting!  I guess Larry doesn't care about this, quite sadly.
p1208
aV@geoffwolfe @larry_kudlow I'm just echoing what Paul Ryan has already said, i.e. that Trump makes racist statements.
p1209
aV@jbarro hilarious.  I mean does he have a cell phone?
p1210
aV@larry_kudlow he makes racist statements, which Paul Ryan himself has admitted.
p1211
aV@larry_kudlow so you can support a man who makes racist and bigoted statements just because you agree with his tax plan?  Wow.
p1212
aV@tonyschwartz @SusanPoe7 sounds like an overstatement.  I'm no Trump fan but he makes plenty of jokes at his rallies (and in the debates)
p1213
aV@EmilyMiller  huh?  I don't get it and don't get why it's redacted
p1214
aV@mcuban @elizabethforma is she really calling him a name?  "Coward" just seems more like a fact.
p1215
aV@jbarro well said Josh!
p1216
aV@joshtpm bwahahahahah
p1217
aV@jacobkornbluh @KellyannePolls bizarre.  Aren't they establishment??
p1218
aV@HillsMedRecords is this real???!
p1219
aV@jpodhoretz @mfcurtis66 Revenant blows.  12 Yrs a Slave was incredible and the best film of the 2010's.  The Town a close 2nd.
p1220
aV@scottlincicome #Hannityface
p1221
aV@lanticavirtu @mtaibbi SA is liberalizing, albeit at a snail's pace.  (I think women can drive in some regions now).
p1222
aV@musicman495 @ABC @ThisWeekABC why doesn't ABC fact check him here?  The lies the Trump folks get away with are absurd.
p1223
aV@ABC @ThisWeekABC https://t.co/0R1LI1Ri6q
p1224
aV@ABC @ThisWeekABC Giuliani completely made up that statement about Dukakis-Bush polling in Sept.  Could you please fact check him on that?
p1225
aV@TDOWNINGS @DanaPerino Exactly, the state is disgusted with him and by extension, the GOP.
p1226
aV@DanaPerino is it at all surprising when the guy at the top of the ticket enjoys making racist and bigoted statements?
p1227
aV@Nouriel It's just totally ridiculous.  A sad joke like the rest of his campaign.
p1228
aV@scottienhughes @Johnnydontlike @ReliableSources @brianstelter Can you talk about how Trump said that "wages are too high"?  Thanks Scottie!
p1229
aV@stuartpstevens @msmquinn 40% or so will vote for him.  Could be enough.
p1230
aV@AlexisinNH @alivitali guess so!!
p1231
aV@jjauthor this is just stupid
p1232
aV@AlexisinNH @alivitali despite his racist and bigoted comments?
p1233
aV@politico possible but hard to imagine with inflation trudging along around 1%
p1234
aV@jpodhoretz @seanhannity haha Stephens is brilliant?  Yikes
p1235
aV@teddyschleifer you mean red?
p1236
aV@IngrahamAngle it's insane NOT to borrow that much with rates where they are.  We should be borrowing a lot more.
p1237
aV@chuckwoolery why did Trump say he saw a video of it?
p1238
aV@mlcalderone wow.  So brave.
p1239
aV@gehrig38 at least Trump never lies
p1240
aV@seanhannity @StephensWSJ @Yahoo @stableford come on Sean.  Call him "WSJ genius" again!
p1241
aV@seanhannity @StephensWSJ @Yahoo @stableford GOP falling apart at the seams
p1242
aV@seanhannity @StephensWSJ @Yahoo @stableford oh man.  This is amazing!!!
p1243
aV@realDonaldTrump cool!  You gonna release your tax returns?
p1244
aV@DanaSchwartzzz zero.  This guy will milk every second of the spotlight he has for next 3 mos.
p1245
aV@jpodhoretz what polling company?
p1246
aV@PhilipRucker wonder where he plans to get $10m?
p1247
aV@tmorello @BoundBya_Line would you at least admit Hillary is 10000x better than Trump?
p1248
aV@jimcramer @GlennInvestor @CNBC Jim you were 100% right.  Love this clip!!
p1249
aV@jbarro oh so much wealthier.  Whitman has $5b at a minimum.  Trump around 100-300m
p1250
aV@Osloweknownas @maggieNYT @alexburnsNYT he needs to explain absolutely nothing
p1251
aV@linderje I've lost track...are you still supporting the bigot who disrespects veterans?
p1252
aV@linderje @politico care to provide a specific example?
p1253
aV@heytana hi Tana!  Are you as disrespectful toward vets as Trump is??
p1254
aV@tylercowen I don't think I agree.  They will jump ship as soon as they see he can't win.
p1255
aV@gehrig38 right, just like Trump is too I guess.
p1256
aV@ananavarro why do you love someone who supports a man who says racist things?
p1257
aV@MaxBoot no chance this will happen.  They know Trump may win this election.
p1258
aV@linderje @JonahNRO No b/c my answers are logical.  You: let's elect an impulsive, macho, bigoted man b/c we don't know if he's competent
p1259
aV@linderje @JonahNRO haha.  that's some airtight logic right there.
p1260
aV@linderje @JonahNRO right because Trump would definitely keep everyone safe.  He's proven totally competent in his business ventures.
p1261
aV@linderje @JonahNRO Wow.  What a horrible insult to our immigrants and armed forces.
p1262
aV@David_Gergen You are making irresponsible assertions and should really amend them.
p1263
aV@David_Gergen And no Trump is not right, he is alleging a ridiculous conspiracy that is simply untrue.
p1264
aV@David_Gergen so you're saying there are a lot of people who would normally watch the debate, but only if there is no NFL game on?!  Absurd.
p1265
aV@linderje @JonahNRO John are you still in the Trump camp even after he viciously insulted a Gold Star mother?
p1266
aV@LariskaPargitay @mattyglesias @ChrisMegerian just so disturbing that he has a solid 35%-40% of the electorate no matter what he says
p1267
aV@jonfavs when do the next OH/PA polls come out?  That's really all that matters right now
p1268
aV@LariskaPargitay @mattyglesias @ChrisMegerian oh so Trump lied about something?  Weird.
p1269
aV@mattyglesias @ChrisMegerian also did he claim trump hadn't read it, or did he merely ask?
p1270
aV@scottienhughes just totally revolting to insult Mr. Khan's mother like that.  Veterans should be completely ashamed of this man.
p1271
aV@scottienhughes ahh right.  Trump is a huge reader, I can tell.  Those pesky word slips sure have piled up though.
p1272
aV@scottienhughes oh and how did the father lie?  Trump has read the constitution but thinks it has 9 Articles?
p1273
aV@scottienhughes you are delusional.  He attacked that hero's poor mother for being too upset to talk about her son.  This is disgusting.
p1274
aV@scottienhughes @USATODAY wow are you seriously still supporting this man?  What did you think of his disgusting attack on the soldiers mom?
p1275
aV@scottienhughes so do you support his disgusting attack of this gold star family?
p1276
aV@nickgillespie @KevinMKruse also I bet none of this affects his poll #s in the slightest
p1277
aV@DrJillStein @tvonetv @TheBpDShow @rolandsmartin hey Jill!  Question for you -- do you realize you may help Donald trump become President?
p1278
aV@JeffreyGoldberg @IreneAdlerCal are you kidding?  Can't stand trump but no one is "bringing him down"
p1279
aV@Care4Ocean @Vote4JillStein1 @TLImusic this is just dumb.  It's not "always" where we get a unique idiot like Trump.  Wake the hell up
p1280
aV@Care4Ocean @Vote4JillStein1 @TLImusic vote your values the next election where there is not a madman running as the opponent.
p1281
aV@Care4Ocean @Vote4JillStein1 @TLImusic ok well she is not going to get elected and Hillary needs all the votes she can get to stop Trump
p1282
aV@TLImusic @DrJillStein do you guys want to get Trump elected?
p1283
aV@ninatypewriter lol no Chance he leaves that's for sure
p1284
aV@GavinNewsom you really think so?  I think he genuinely wants to debate her and may win.  Guy knows TV.    Keep up the good work Gavin!
p1285
aV@realDonaldTrump can you at least spell "lose" correctly?
p1286
aV@morningmoneyben @craig_crawford so can you write more articles abt it?
p1287
aV@MattMurph24 she's an amazing idiot
p1288
aV@stuartpstevens @Uncle_Jimbo why do you respect people who support Trump?  He's a racist, as even Republicans agree.  Should be unacceptable
p1289
aV@AriFleischer consumer spending is growing at an extremely healthy pace
p1290
aV@AriFleischer and by the way, if you actually read the report GDP is low because government spending is shrinking
p1291
aV@AriFleischer great instincts Ari.  Unemployment low and the stock market high but GDP growth is totally what voters care abt
p1292
aV@BillKristol her message is to not elect an imbecilic dictator.  Not strong enough?
p1293
aV@pittipatch @JonahNRO yup
p1294
aV@pittipatch @JonahNRO climate change is man made, say 99% of scientists
p1295
aV@JonahNRO her speech was fantastic.  Refreshing to hear from a candidate who believes in science.
p1296
aV@CharlesMBlow no trump fan but he's a pretty damn good orator I hate to admit
p1297
aV@ananavarro why does Ivanka seem wonderful exactly?
p1298
aV@thehill this is huge.  Has he been asked about it?
p1299
aV@JohnJHarwood @ABswl16 this is huge.  Didn't he deny knowing Putin yesterday?!!
p1300
aV@sebastianbach @mutalabala @RollingStone wait a minute are you a Trump man, Bas?!
p1301
aV@BillKristol why do you think people aren't startled?
p1302
aV@MattMurph24 @pinkbunny70 but sadly Fox News will still exist so these idiots will always have a home somewhere
p1303
aV@stuartpstevens @JohnJHarwood Stu -- looking a lot like trump wins this election.  Are you still denying it's likely?
p1304
aV@DuffMcKagan you catch a replay of the DNC?
p1305
aV@robreiner well can't you do anything?  You have a microphone at least.  We don't.
p1306
aV@NateWatkins @kayleighmcenany responding to mcenany is pointless.  All her posts are nonsensical.
p1307
aV@amayasays I guess but I'd be cool with a 3rd Obama term.  And he would crush Trump.
p1308
aV@amayasays I know right?!  Why do we have term limits again???
p1309
aV@secupp haha hilarious and idiotic take.
p1310
aV@amayasays seriously how good was that speech?!
p1311
aV@linderje right, he only became President of the United States.
p1312
aV@cenkuygur Kaines speech was terrible.  What did that do to earn votes in Pa/OH?
p1313
aV@JamesFallows @ObsoleteDogma so trump is pro-American?  In what way?  His bigotry or disregard of all facts?
p1314
aV@realDonaldTrump correct -- you said you would get rid of them in 5 minutes.
p1315
aV@RobertJShiller very sorry for the loss, Professor.  He will be greatly missed.
p1316
aV@Ingersoll007 @clmazin @MrAndyNgo thanks I'll check it out.  I've also read some Bernard Lewis stuff that's quite helpful
p1317
aV@Ingersoll007 @clmazin @MrAndyNgo genuinely appreciate the Looming Tower recc and am open to other suggestions on books explaining Islam
p1318
aV@Ingersoll007 @clmazin @MrAndyNgo well then why do most of them behave peacefully?
p1319
aV@Ingersoll007 @clmazin @MrAndyNgo agree.  All Im saying is the terrorist groups represent a harmful perversion of the Muslim religion.
p1320
aV@Ingersoll007 @clmazin @MrAndyNgo so you're saying the vast majority of Salafists are incorrectly interpreting their religion.  Interesting.
p1321
aV@Ingersoll007 @clmazin @MrAndyNgo I think he's offended them a hell of a lot less than our last president and the vast majority of GOP
p1322
aV@Ingersoll007 @clmazin @MrAndyNgo Would you say the Bible is peaceful?  (P.S. I'm a Christian)
p1323
aV@Ingersoll007 @clmazin @MrAndyNgo so are you saying there are zero peaceful practitioners of Salafism?
p1324
aV@Ingersoll007 @clmazin @MrAndyNgo so Obama is wrong on this?
p1325
aV@Ingersoll007 @clmazin @MrAndyNgo how would you explain the peaceful Sunni Salafists?
p1326
aV@Ingersoll007 @clmazin @MrAndyNgo "underpins" because terrorist groups have chosen to use it as a pretext
p1327
aV@clmazin @MrAndyNgo yes, all of which are perversions of the same religion.  As Obama has also stated.
p1328
aV@clmazin @MrAndyNgo it's about a perversion of a religion.  Doesn't everyone agree on that?
p1329
aV@RonBrownstein @zoidumicj what are McCain, martinez's, Ryan and rubios talents, again?
p1330
aV@AriFleischer economics ain't science Ari
p1331
aV@MiddleClassDem @mrb00mbastick @CharlesMBlow according to NYT there is evidence
p1332
aV@CharlesMBlow so you're saying it shouldn't be a concern that Russia is meddling in the US elections?
p1333
aV@MelissaLeeCNBC where is that??  Looks awesome!
p1334
aV@mayberrypatriot @stuartpstevens @darthhomme if he loses Utah it will be to Johnson
p1335
aV@crampell @delong @RexNutting what??  Doubled since the 80's?  But isn't that when America was Great?!??
p1336
aV@cathymac21 @stuartpstevens @derbybound33 @darthhomme sadly it's getting more and more likely.
p1337
aV@darthhomme @TheEclipse__ @stuartpstevens I guess we'll know in a week or two if it's just the ordinary bump.
p1338
aV@stuartpstevens @darthhomme I hope with all my heart that you're right!  The polls do not look good for her right now.
p1339
aV@stuartpstevens @darthhomme and btw again that larger than normal white turnout pretty much only needs to be in FL/PA/OH
p1340
aV@stuartpstevens @darthhomme agree but it's a stretch to call his support "all white".
p1341
aV@BillCortese @stuartpstevens no a republican does not need to hit that if there is big enough white turnout
p1342
aV@cmercury25 @stuartpstevens @darthhomme totally agree
p1343
aV@stuartpstevens @darthhomme he's also drawing ~15% of Hispanics, which is not insignificant.
p1344
aV@McCormickProf  they would be nowhere near "catastrophic", which a trump admin surely would be
p1345
aV@secupp @CNN he's 100% right
p1346
aV@chuckwoolery can you give a specific example Chuck?
p1347
aV@jaketapper @Penn what the hell are you talking about Jake?  Trump started at Fordham remember.
p1348
aV@MaxBoot @DAlexBlumenthal curious to hear your opinion on Trump's alleged Russian connections:  https://t.co/6hcsb9nmYk
p1349
aV@mattyglesias pretty sure you're not spelling waste "waist".
p1350
aV@jaketapper @BernieSanders @CNNSotu the only person Kaine is the opposite of is Trump.  For one thing, he knows how to spell.
p1351
aV@StephensWSJ don't forget "waist".  the GOP nominee can't even spell.  SAD!
p1352
aV@chrissyteigen this idiot can't even spell.  SAD!!!!
p1353
aV@RBReich do you think he may be pandering w: 1) switching on the TPP; and 2) speaking Spanish?
p1354
aV@DanaSchwartzzz how dumb is she???
p1355
aV@PhilipRucker if it were any other Dem leading the ticket, I'd agree with you
p1356
aV@realDonaldTrump didn't you say in a debate that wages are too high?
p1357
aV@jaketapper @jonfavs @davidplouffe I agree with the need to be sensitive.  But also must be vigilant pointing out unwarranted hysterics
p1358
aV@ananavarro hmm guess you haven't read up on Pence!
p1359
aV@jonfavs @jaketapper @davidplouffe Tapper way off here.  No one is mocking anyone's fears, just mocking people trying to stoke those fears.
p1360
aV@BillKristol didn't you say that would be the Rick Perry candidacy?  Yikes
p1361
aV@paulkrugman https://t.co/q2YYDjzACT
p1362
aV@jjauthor  the only one smearing anyone today is trump
p1363
aV@ReformedBroker trump stuff stopped being fun around February
p1364
aV@GovGaryJohnson @Newsday Good luck Gary!  Let us know how we can help you!!!
p1365
aV@aseitzwald @stuartpstevens dumb overstatement but ok
p1366
aV@MartinShkreli are you nuts??
p1367
aV@mikebarnicle dude.  He admitted he also hates it yesterday.  Do you read transcripts??!
p1368
aV@heytana @realDonaldTrump hey Tana!  This is so pathetic.  He is losing every poll....badly!!!!
p1369
aV@Neil_Irwin why would they endorse Hillary instead of Gary Johnson?
p1370
aV@jack_welch @chuckwoolery guy stuck to his principles at least
p1371
aV@kayleighmcenany no.  He means down ballot repubs.  DUH
p1372
aV@jack_welch come on Jack what about principles?!
p1373
aV@benshapiro @mkraju what's wrong with having a Treasury Secretary be from Goldman?
p1374
aV@jimgeraghty @KenGardner11 they have similar purposes.  Make life exciting and provide an outlet for people w/o much going on
p1375
aV@ReformedBroker @RiskReversal @templeofthedog no vedder is a little weak
p1376
aV@nylitgirl why are they impressive?  What have they accomplished exactly?
p1377
aV@narents but guarantee he'd prefer 4 more yrs to handing the keys to Trump...
p1378
aV@narents yeah he definitely is.
p1379
aV@narents I would take another 4 yrs of Obama in a heartbeat
p1380
aV@narents why do we have term limits again??....
p1381
aV@narents ha I agree.  It's totally disgusting
p1382
aV@canativeobt @cenkuygur cenk does nothing
p1383
aV@narents have you been watching this GOP dumpster fire?
p1384
aV@narents @davidaxelrod @JenniferJJacobs I know right?  Wtf is Axe doing.  And I love u Axe btw
p1385
aV@davidaxelrod @JenniferJJacobs oh come on David.  Don't be dumb here.
p1386
aV@billmaher bill -- do something!  This family completely sucks!!!
p1387
aV@campbell_brown @dansenor why not just go ahead and endorse Gary Johnson?  What are you waiting for??
p1388
aV@campbell_brown @dansenor pointless gesture
p1389
aV@jbarro and I guess "we" are, since 40% of the voters in this country support him.  Sad!
p1390
aV@IngrahamAngle @LATshowtracker there will be a hell of a lot more tolerance, I guarantee it
p1391
aV@ScottDisick you're not watching the Republican convention?
p1392
aV@DrBrianMay trump just played a Queen song.  What the hell?!
p1393
aV@nilbog4200 @prophetsofrage ahh ok awesome!!
p1394
aV@prophetsofrage love you guys but this is embarrassing
p1395
aV@prophetsofrage wow this looks really sad.  Was there an actual concert too or just this?
p1396
aV@TPM wow.  Story of the day.  He is an utter disagrace
p1397
aV@TheRickWilson @DrewMannTN lol.  He would have been so bad.
p1398
aV@scottlincicome @gzornick @chrislhayes why would you?  Their ideas are just terrible
p1399
aV@prophetsofrage is there an actual concert or just this?
p1400
aV@KsLiberal @linderje @AndreaTantaros how so?
p1401
aV@KsLiberal @linderje @AndreaTantaros your point?
p1402
aV@AlexisinNH @KurtSchlichter I assume you agree with all this Alexis?
p1403
aV@linderje @AndreaTantaros I was talking abt the Bible generally (very violent book), but if you insist you can check Luke 19:27.
p1404
aV@chrislhayes @mattyglesias looking more and more like Johnson gets there too
p1405
aV@SopanDeb this is so weird
p1406
aV@SopanDeb man he's a bigger dummy than Trump
p1407
aV@sebastianbach @SaintsandTide @Slash @matthewbwake oh man.  Give us some memories Bas!
p1408
aV@rgspol @duttslist1 @morningmoneyben @sarahzview @realDonaldTrump nah.  She never followed up on the most obvious topics
p1409
aV@rgspol @duttslist1 @morningmoneyben @sarahzview @realDonaldTrump yeah so weird.  She is not a great journalist sadly.
p1410
aV@nylitgirl @JoeNBC @realDonaldTrump good god that interview was a disaster
p1411
aV@day54 @stuartpstevens his Pence pick was major tactical blunder.  Goes completely against the entire outsider schtick.
p1412
aV@linderje @AndreaTantaros maybe check out Numbers 31?
p1413
aV@linderje @AndreaTantaros if you need more passages, just let me know!  Your "religion of peace" stuff just doesn't really work.
p1414
aV@linderje @AndreaTantaros maybe start with Deuteronomy 20:16-17.
p1415
aV@linderje @AndreaTantaros so John, is Christianity a peaceful religion?  Have you ever read the Bible?
p1416
aV@jjauthor he's actually done a great job
p1417
aV@narents @chrislhayes @LesleyRStahl just wish she asked! ;)
p1418
aV@chrislhayes @LesleyRStahl just wish she asked why Pence can "make a mistake" but Hillary can't...
p1419
aV@davidfrum @noonanjo who the hell is John Noonan?
p1420
aV@AlexisinNH did you watch that 60 mins interview?  Wow it was disastrous
p1421
aV@heytana hey Tana!  Did you watch that 60 Minutes Interview?  What a complete disaster :(...
p1422
aV@ConspiracyMaker @stuartpstevens lol.  A lifelong dem who got 45% of the GOP vote
p1423
aV@GeraldoRivera don't overstate things Geraldo.  This isn't a civil war
p1424
aV@ConspiracyMaker @stuartpstevens trumps poll #s are just embarrassing
p1425
aV@ConspiracyMaker @stuartpstevens haha nope.  Good luck with Trump!  Today's polls look great for him.
p1426
aV@ConspiracyMaker @stuartpstevens no I'm just saying that a high stock market explains part of obama's high approval
p1427
aV@ConspiracyMaker @stuartpstevens considering 50% of Americans own stocks, it's not just 1%'ers
p1428
aV@ConspiracyMaker @stuartpstevens could have to do w/record high stock market and low unemployment
p1429
aV@stuartpstevens pres approval is 56%.  Hard to see cakewalk under normal circumstances
p1430
aV@JohnJHarwood any Johnson/stein?
p1431
aV@soledadobrien @rschles @ScottBaio I'm confused.  Why is Scott Baio newsworthy?
p1432
aV@amyschumer I don't get it
p1433
aV@StephensWSJ if trump loses this one, he or another trump-like figure will simply run again and get 40%+ of the GOP vote
p1434
aV@StephensWSJ but wasn't Jeb making this argument throughout the primary process?  What makes one think it will work in 2020?
p1435
aV@MelissaAFrancis @coldplay front row??
p1436
aV@mike_pence @AlexisinNH does he still not believe in global warming?  What about thinking cigarettes aren't bad for you?
p1437
aV@Sportsgirl24242 @RealMichaelKay @PaulONeillYES is Michael a trump supporter like Paulie?
p1438
aV@heytana do you agree with Pence that global warming is a myth and that smoking isn't bad for you?
p1439
aV@JaredWyand @jjauthor can you post a link to those polls?
p1440
aV@DavidCarrJaxFL @PaulBegala @NYMrBig how about "Dumbass Donald"??
p1441
aV@DanaSchwartzzz @mike_pence @Chilis in New York City.
p1442
aV@LoganLevkoff lol.  Pretty much instantaneous
p1443
aV@AlexisinNH FBI said she broke no laws
p1444
aV@AlexisinNH I'm 100% not voting for her, actually
p1445
aV@AlexisinNH she violated no federal laws according to the FBI
p1446
aV@ninatypewriter @ABC wow, much lower rate than in the 90's.
p1447
aV@AlexisinNH well he is openly saying he will commit war crimes.  Oh yeah and he ran a fraudulent, fake, university.
p1448
aV@AlexisinNH @HillaryClinton trump has so much less respect for the law than Hillary it's not even funny
p1449
aV@stuartpstevens @musepolsci would he ever leave office if not impeached?
p1450
aV@jbarro white crewneck undershirt is also highly questionable
p1451
aV@stuartpstevens @jaketapper these new polls are totally useless w/o Johnson and stein
p1452
aV@mmurraypolitics polls w/o Stein and Johnson are completely useless!
p1453
aV@linderje @BillKristol her time heading State was almost as impressive as Trump's time heading a fake university
p1454
aV@SullyCNBC i also hope France itself steps up and does what is needed.  I.e. Start spending more on defense and take leadership v Isis...
p1455
aV@SullyCNBC great thoughts Brian, well said.
p1456
aV@Ombudsman @brianstelter @LukeRussert @DougHeye @CNNMoney or the category "why does CNN waste everyone's time reporting on this stuff?"
p1457
aV@brianstelter @LukeRussert @DougHeye @Ombudsman @CNNMoney is this really considered newsworthy??
p1458
aV@jchaltiwanger yeah Hill is so funny and spontaneous
p1459
aV@pinkbunny70 @fawfulfan I don't know, even NYTimes and WApost think she should not be commenting on the race
p1460
aV@fawfulfan @pinkbunny70 ginsburgs remarks were much more irresponsible.
p1461
aV@stuartpstevens @chassIII @chernithings what's your read on the FL poll?  Trump has substantial lead in 4 way race.
p1462
aV@fawfulfan @pinkbunny70 huh?  That comment means nothing.  Ginsburg's remarks were much more irresponsible
p1463
aV@GovGaryJohnson @ChrisSnyderFox @FoxNews great job Gary!!!
p1464
aV@benshapiro who cares abt national polls?  He is winning in OH/FL/PA.  May very well lose popular but win electoral
p1465
aV@jpodhoretz @AGMcThugabobs @continetti @Commentary Trump wins OH/PA/FL and he can't be beat
p1466
aV@jpodhoretz @AGMcThugabobs @continetti @Commentary he is beating her by a substantial margin in FL w/Stein and Johnson in the mix.
p1467
aV@LukeRussert good luck Luke!  I was a desk assistant at NBC in DC in 01-03 and have really enjoyed watching your ascent.
p1468
aV@JeffersonObama @pinkbunny70 when were all of these?  What abt the IA poll where Trump is winning?  (I'm anti-trump but genuinely worried)
p1469
aV@prophetsofrage ohh how I wish there was a vid!!
p1470
aV@mmurraypolitics @PaulBegala perhaps NbC should report more prominently every time he makes a false statement?
p1471
aV@AriMelber @JonahNRO @NBCNews @meetthepress @mmurraypolitics @chucktodd @Lawrence @chrislhayes trump claims ruling's in his favor.  True?
p1472
aV@mtomasky lol
p1473
aV@BillKristol @TheFix Boehner?
p1474
aV@jbarro I guess I've gotten lucky.  As for other tech companies going downhill, Instacart is pretty horrible
p1475
aV@jbarro how has seamless ruined it?  I've been using it 2-3 times a week for 10 yrs and think it's pretty great...
p1476
aV@ktibus @NewYorker @adamgopnik lots of factors including lots of guns.  I am just saying that his statement isn't true for the US over time
p1477
aV@NewYorker @adamgopnik then why has gun violence decreased as # of guns has increased?
p1478
aV@ClistonBrown @CookPolitical I think Hill may take NC/AZ/UT but 4 months is a long time and things change
p1479
aV@thedavid70 @kayleighmcenany @CNNTonight that's disgraceful
p1480
aV@kayleighmcenany @CNNTonight are you going to criticize Obama again like you did before the tragedy even unfolded?  What a total disgrace
p1481
aV@unchuq @scottienhughes LOL!!
p1482
aV@mattyglesias note that the price has been declining for 2 decades
p1483
aV@DebraMessing got any specific ideas??
p1484
aV@BellamyYoung any specific ideas?
p1485
aV@stuartpstevens @SykesCharlie haha nice one Stu :)
p1486
aV@ChrisCuomo @raincoatgirl_ any word yet on suspects?  Are they still at large??
p1487
aV@tas0417 @kayleighmcenany Obama waited until the next day.  Mcenany is all over Obama within 5 minutes of the incident
p1488
aV@tas0417 @kayleighmcenany many do, I just think it would show more class to at least wait until tomorrow out of respect for the victims
p1489
aV@tas0417 @kayleighmcenany I didn't see any dems criticizing and patronizing our president in the midst of those crises
p1490
aV@tas0417 @kayleighmcenany yeah but I don't know why she is obsessed with the political implications in the midst of an absolute tragedy.
p1491
aV@kayleighmcenany thanks but how about focusing on the tragic nature of this instead of immediately discussing its political implications?
p1492
aV@DouthatNYT you think this is more 70s than 60s?
p1493
aV@heytana more horrendous polls released today.  Is trump embarrassed??
p1494
aV@soxxgo2009 @larry_kudlow it really is sad to watch.
p1495
aV@larry_kudlow he'll need plenty of it in light of his continued terrible poll #s!
p1496
aV@AnnCoulter oh I'm sure Donald will ask plenty in the debate.
p1497
aV@DebraMessing @KevinDarryl sort of absurd to argue that she's being held to a tougher standard than Petraeus.  He was charged, she wasn't.
p1498
aV@EmilyMiller hilarious Emily.  Guess they haven't been looking at the polls?
p1499
aV@IngrahamAngle @MaxBoot @Matthew_Artz yup and Romney lost handily to Obama in the general.  What's your point?
p1500
aV@rebeccarnelson @TheRickWilson thanks, will do!
p1501
aV@rebeccarnelson @TheRickWilson (president and vp candidates)
p1502
aV@rebeccarnelson @TheRickWilson they can't be from the same state
p1503
aV@DougKass @SullyCNBC @Mktsurfer agree Sully is awesome.  Top 3 faves on CNBC: 1) Cramer; 2) Sully; 3) Fortt
p1504
aV@AlexisinNH guess not just like the other guy can't understand how government bonds work
p1505
aV@jpodhoretz i am no trump supporter but we cannot count him out until the election
p1506
aV@jpodhoretz (p.s. Not a trump supporter)
p1507
aV@jpodhoretz he still may.  There are 3 debates and he is much better at them than she is.
p1508
aV@heytana hey Tana you see those latest polls?  Sad -- Trump is so pathetic in them!
p1509
aV@GregPique @SenSanders so I'll assume you don't want to label all apples.  Where do you want to draw the line?
p1510
aV@GregPique @SenSanders just asking a question.  (Which I guess you don't feel like answering for some reason).
p1511
aV@GregPique @SenSanders technically all apples are GMOs, as humans breed them and thus modify their genetics.  Label required on all apples?
p1512
aV@GregPique @SenSanders they have the right to know without manufacturers being forced to add a scary label
p1513
aV@SenSanders could you point us to a study showing that GMOs have caused harm in humans?
p1514
aV@realDonaldTrump @AlexisinNH wonder if 3 bankruptcies makes you more fit?
p1515
aV@JonahNRO @BretBaier gross negligence is a higher standard than extremely careless.  See:  https://t.co/sR1KV2UdUj
p1516
aV@Bubbler35 @ABC just wondering why this takes precedence over the other horrible incidents
p1517
aV@scottienhughes @Misslinlou @realDonaldTrump @CNN are you still supporting trump??
p1518
aV@kourtneykardash yikes
p1519
aV@pmarca good point!
p1520
aV@Neil_Irwin @pmarca great point Neil
p1521
aV@pmarca they were pretty confident in 98 too
p1522
aV@nathanlean @inklake were the terrorists Muslim?
p1523
aV@thehill who pays for Christie's trips to campaign for Trump?
p1524
aV@MMFlint what are you even saying?  They also have 300k people.  Same size as Toledo
p1525
aV@realDonaldTrump who pays for Christie when he campaigns for you?  You Moron
p1526
aV@Bubbler35 @ABC he is, and it's a horrendous tragedy.  same goes for everyone else who died in this country today
p1527
aV@Bubbler35 @ABC huh?
p1528
aV@ABC why is this newsworthy?
p1529
aV@jonfortt great post, Jon.
p1530
aV@ianbremmer @maggieNYT @rezahakbari my goodness
p1531
aV@jack_welch jack, what do you think of Trump's racist statements?
p1532
aV@DanSoderburg @benshapiro yeah but no.  Needs to say who he is behind instead of just slinging mud ad nauseum
p1533
aV@Rockprincess818 @evbot16 @YousefMunayyer so you don't care about his bigotry?  Wow so disturbing
p1534
aV@jasian12345 crossed a serious line here
p1535
aV@jasian12345 really?
p1536
aV@jasian12345 whoa
p1537
aV@benshapiro man, this guy Ben is a total dumbass
p1538
aV@BrianJWaz @evbot16 @benshapiro are you really this stupid?
p1539
aV@PeterTownsend7 why don't you answer my earlier tweet to you?
p1540
aV@BrianJWaz @evbot16 @benshapiro so no difference on his racism?  Dummy
p1541
aV@BrianJWaz @evbot16 @benshapiro he's an idiot
p1542
aV@benshapiro how about the 3500 victims of W's failed Iraq war?  You Idiot.
p1543
aV@evbot16 @BrianJWaz @benshapiro Ev, Ben is a total moron
p1544
aV@benshapiro or just trying to have it both ways?
p1545
aV@benshapiro and you're totally supporting trump right?
p1546
aV@QueenOfCali3x5 @Andy Clapton listing was my "famous guitarist" listing.  If we broaden it I doubt he makes it either
p1547
aV@BrianJWaz @benshapiro @BrittanyLCorona yeah but it's idiotic to sit there and bitch yet have no solutions
p1548
aV@gelliottmorris @NateSilver538 she has this
p1549
aV@QueenOfCali3x5 @Andy as I said I agree he's great!  Guess you can't read?  (See prior tweets)
p1550
aV@benshapiro @BrianJWaz @BrittanyLCorona so Ben you're a Hillary guy right?  I'll assume that until you say otherwise
p1551
aV@QueenOfCali3x5 @Andy guess you don't play guitar Tam!
p1552
aV@PeterTownsend7 and by the way, what is your point?
p1553
aV@PeterTownsend7 what religion is rational?
p1554
aV@QueenOfCali3x5 @Andy and not in the top 1000 if we are counting non-famous people
p1555
aV@QueenOfCali3x5 @Andy I totally admit he's good!  Just not in the top 30 living, not even close
p1556
aV@Andy weird tweet by Andy but I guess we forgive him?
p1557
aV@benshapiro it's hilarious how this idiot doesn't even say who he's supporting
p1558
aV@DaveMustaine why not
p1559
aV@benshapiro this trump stuff is just weird if you're not gonna say who you're for
p1560
aV@benshapiro who are you voting for?
p1561
aV@benshapiro dude
p1562
aV@Andy whoa!  Oops, Forgot 1) jimmy Page; 2) Eric Clapton; 3) stone Goddard; 4) mark Tremonti
p1563
aV@Andy 1) Tom morello; 2) Kirk Hammett; 3) Slash; 4) Dan Donegan; 5) Frusciante
p1564
aV@Andy hahahahahah not even close
p1565
aV@AlexisinNH oh so it's not racist to say a judge can't do his job bc of his ethnicity?  You disagree with Paul Ryan I guess?
p1566
aV@AlexisinNH sad that racism is a yawn to you
p1567
aV@AlexisinNH at least she's not a racist
p1568
aV@scottienhughes @realDonaldTrump @DanScavino you see the latest polls?  Totally pathetic!
p1569
aV@stuartpstevens @maggieNYT yeah.  Too bad his "anti trump pressure" will amount to absolutely nothing
p1570
aV@CharlesMBlow I'm not a Trump supporter but it's a big deal.
p1571
aV@EmilyMiller what does that even mean?  When would we not be "on defense"?
p1572
aV@benshapiro @TIME has anyone disproved her Native American ancestry?
p1573
aV@EricTrump @Rambobiggs no, it didn't show any of that actually
p1574
aV@ckhoma6 @BenSasse 4.9 unemployment.  But wait let me guess!   It's fake?!?!
p1575
aVRT @Green_Footballs: The sister of Ambassador Chris Stevens speaks out: Don't Blame Hillary Clinton for Benghazi https://t.co/SK48M0NXru vi\u2026
p1576
aV@ckhoma6 @BenSasse that's just idiotic.  What does the "real #" mean?  You're smarter than labor dept I guess??
p1577
aV@ckhoma6 @BenSasse they are better than every developed country btw.
p1578
aV@mfckrx @blitznstitch @BenSasse no, referring to it as free trade is actually just fine
p1579
aV@ckhoma6 @BenSasse hey guy.  Unemployment is sub 5%
p1580
aV@jpcintheop @BenSasse happy to debate Sasse and pretty sure I'd win!
p1581
aV@ckhoma6 @BenSasse what does that even mean?  So??  Obama is unaware of that fact?
p1582
aV@jpcintheop @BenSasse thanks Jerry
p1583
aV@gehrig38 @77WABCradio @bernieandsid hey Schill, the Behghazi report found nothing new.  So case closed, right??
p1584
aV@stuartpstevens @Timodc @TBCJay the weird thing is that Mitts logic in "Mitt" holds more true now.  He doesn't want it but has the ability
p1585
aV@gehrig38 @77WABCradio @bernieandsid why do you keep talking about Benghazi instead of those 3500+?  It's just weird
p1586
aV@BenSasse Senator, I love what you're doing v Trump but these are cliches.  There is never a "conversation."
p1587
aV@gehrig38 @77WABCradio @bernieandsid thanks smart guy Schill!  And your answer to my q re the 3500+ that died thanks to W?
p1588
aV@realDonaldTrump what are you even talking about?  "Realize what's going on"?  Really?  The "world" doesn't realize this?  Nice try idiot
p1589
aV@gehrig38 @77WABCradio @bernieandsid oh is that right Curt?  I'm an idiot?  How do you feel abt the 3500 lost in Iraq thanks to W?
p1590
aV@davidfrum @USATODAY well not to split hairs but Cheney said he'd support the nominee
p1591
aV@davidfrum @USATODAY has Cheney officially endorsed?  I actually don't think he has...
p1592
aV@gehrig38 @77WABCradio @bernieandsid @JimBreuer @11 dude what are your thoughts on the Benghazi report??
p1593
aV@JMAudioPros @proqbromo @jimcramer no why would I do that.  Said I loved him
p1594
aV@jjauthor huh?  Do you ever talk about the 3500 dead under Bush's Iraq invasion?  Or no?
p1595
aV@proqbromo @jimcramer @JMAudioPros yeah I love Jim but I agree SAR it does seem very weird
p1596
aV@stuartpstevens @JoyAnnReid so dumb Stu.  You're gonna knock Obama for his vacations?  Come on.
p1597
aV@BenSasse what does that even mean dude?  Tired of senators saying we "need a conversation".  So how does that work exactly?  Please explain
p1598
aV@clmazin @EDI_NYC so what's your solution??
p1599
aV@jimcramer @JMAudioPros I hear you.  In any case, if you want sheer entertainment, listen to the Stern interview.
p1600
aV@jimcramer @JMAudioPros really?  What was his best trade?
p1601
aV@kenvogel @ninatypewriter @CLewandowski_ @HarperCollins @politico honestly, who cares about this?
p1602
aV@clmazin @CraigCons no coincidence, it's clear that the religion has a problem with its radical wing.  So...got any solutions??
p1603
aV@jack_welch the greatest in our 240 yr history?  Wow bold statement there Jack.  What has the caliphate done to the US again?
p1604
aV@ChrisCuomo @leehayespr so someone can make racist statements but not be a bigot?  That makes no sense.
p1605
aV@BillKristol why are you happy to donate to some idiot who supports Trump?
p1606
aV@DrJillStein @meetthepress come on Jill.  Is this serious??
p1607
aV@kanyewest does anyone care??
p1608
aV@ReformedBroker I'd argue all stocks are garbage.  Lower today in real $ than they were 16 yrs ago
p1609
aV@Bethenny Sauce on LES is amazing
p1610
aV@ryanstruyk trump 15% (!) support among nonwhites.  Wow
p1611
aV@_spetty great call
p1612
aV@WalshFreedom oh yeah?  what states are going to secede?
p1613
aV@heytana @realDonaldTrump trump is at 33% nationally in the latest Reuters poll.  That is so unbelievably bad!!
p1614
aV@schianooo more maroon 5?
p1615
aV@continetti I guess but betting markets, real markets, and most polls for past 5 days got it totally wrong.  Very worrisome for US polling
p1616
aV@jonfavs @realDenaldTrump why did the polls screw up so badly?  What a disgrace
p1617
aV@McFaul maybe add Trump to the winners list ;)...
p1618
aV@tmorello Brexit?
p1619
aV@RichLowry hilarious to have Lowry opining on markets.  Soros and Icahn will take note!  Hahah
p1620
aV@RichLowry ahh so you're a market expert now Rich?
p1621
aV@RichLowry do you support this outcome?
p1622
aV@linderje no answer here?  Hmmmm....
p1623
aV@linderje @davidaxelrod @danbalz didn't intend to insult you personally.  Just your absurd rationale for Brexit.
p1624
aV@linderje and Rep Linder -- For the record, who are you endorsing for President?  Just curious!
p1625
aV@linderje @davidaxelrod @danbalz right.  Why would a republican care about markets?  Such a dumb statement.
p1626
aV@linderje @davidaxelrod @danbalz "free people should be independent".  What a dumbass statement.  Should New Jersey be independent?
p1627
aV@linderje @davidaxelrod @danbalz give me a break.  US markets are down 600 pts thanks to your stupid idea
p1628
aV@Kelly_Evans yikes!  Although...I bet US markets close up tomorrow.  Just sayin'...
p1629
aV@morningmoneyben plenty of reasons to freak out.  You may want to glance at the US futures as well as every other global market...
p1630
aV@BenSasse @jeffrussellmr59 dude, what are you even talking about?  Have the UK back again?  Huh??
p1631
aV@linderje @davidaxelrod @danbalz John are you serious?  Why is this a victory?
p1632
aV@kayleighmcenany @SkyNews hey why is this good?
p1633
aV@lindsaylohan why are you concerned with this?
p1634
aV@zerohedge % of total votes?
p1635
aV@ochocinco brexit?
p1636
aV@ReformedBroker HOT take
p1637
aV@mattyglesias any idea what the vote total will roughy be in the Brexit vote?
p1638
aV@Nate_Cohn how many total voters expected?
p1639
aV@seanspicer @BernieSanders @HillaryClinton @re link?
p1640
aV@JeffreyGoldberg don Rumsfeld is endorsing Trump
p1641
aV@AlexisinNH @observer yup it's bad.  Almost as bad as advocating war crimes and saying wages are too high
p1642
aV@AlexisinNH agree it's not great.  (Neither was Powell's).
p1643
aV@AlexisinNH @20committee don't know what TL is
p1644
aV@AlexisinNH the issue is risk of blackmail.  My point is merely that Powell was also at risk
p1645
aV@AlexisinNH therefore was also subject to blackmail
p1646
aV@AlexisinNH right but he used personal email which is much less secure than state dept email
p1647
aV@AlexisinNH he conducted state dept business from a personal acct which was subject to being hacked.  No blackmail risk though?
p1648
aV@kerpen @AlexisinNH so I guess that would apply to Colin Powell's email as well?
p1649
aV@scottienhughes I bet he prays a lot more than trump
p1650
aV@KenGardner11 @CNNPolitics weld was a prosecutor and a very tough one at that.
p1651
aV@erinruberry @ninatypewriter less than car accidents and cigarettes but for some reason no one is protesting those!
p1652
aV@PaulBegala @RyanCaseyWA @TPM I'd imagine the rest of the GOP foreign policy establishment will follow suit?  Rice, Powell, Rummy, etc?
p1653
aV@kimiwillingham @FoxNews no way.  It will be Kaine
p1654
aV@ChrisCuomo @jonleehart umm how about being Secretary of State for 3 years instead of running a money-losing company?
p1655
aV@pellman11 @larry_kudlow @realDonaldTrump totally irresponsible of Larry to be backing Trump.  He knows the economics don't work
p1656
aV@larry_kudlow @realDonaldTrump check the Holtz-Eakin study.  The deportation plan is an economic disaster
p1657
aV@larry_kudlow @realDonaldTrump Larry, the deportation plan alone would shave $1T off GDP
p1658
aV@larry_kudlow @batchelorshow he has no trade policy.  He's mentioned a 45% tariff on Chinese goods, which is beyond dumb
p1659
aV@Nate_cohn is anything from him surprising anymore?
p1660
aV@cwforshizzle @heytana @realDonaldTrump umm no
p1661
aV@heytana @realDonaldTrump @dcexaminer @SecretsBedard totally meaningless.  The population has grown.  What's your point?
p1662
aV@CarmenL27018925 @scottienhughes @realDonaldTrump right.  Winning 13m votes (mostly in blue states) is a far cry from the 65m he needs
p1663
aV@scottienhughes @realDonaldTrump how is he competitive at 35% national support?!  LOL!
p1664
aV@scottienhughes @realDonaldTrump and is losing very badly to her in the polls!
p1665
aV@scottienhughes the latter.  But unfortunately Trump is nowhere near the "same result"!
p1666
aV@larry_kudlow you still voting Trump Larry?
p1667
aV@mcuban @MichaelCohen212 @RealTrentFlubbs @realDonaldTrump love the tweets Mark!  Keep em coming!!
p1668
aV@KasraDean @scottienhughes haha oh yeah he has $10 billion in the bank.  I almost forgot!
p1669
aV@KasraDean @scottienhughes or maybe he's studying briefing books?  His analysis of US debt seems particularly cogent
p1670
aV@KasraDean @scottienhughes ahh yeah I can tell.  Diligently fundraising I guess.
p1671
aV@KasraDean @scottienhughes good logic there
p1672
aV@KasraDean @scottienhughes so Trump hasn't "started" yet?  What has he been doing these past 6 weeks?  Horrendously bad time management
p1673
aV@KasraDean @scottienhughes oh is that right??  Then why did trump cite them daily throughout the entire primary process?
p1674
aV@scottienhughes you see the latest polls?  They are horrendous
p1675
aV@DonaldJTrumpJr @kimberlydvorak these are not comparable at all
p1676
aV@ReformedBroker @igorvolsky I'm pro gun control but I actually think the r's may have a point here.  800k people on the watch list
p1677
aV@scottienhughes you see the latest Trump financials?  Yikes...
p1678
aV@T_FisherKing @Timodc @kjbert nope $10B.  But still felt the need to put his name on steaks.
p1679
aV@Timodc @kjbert you must be forgetting Trump's $10 billion dollars.
p1680
aVRT @realDonaldTrump: Amazing how the haters &amp; losers keep tweeting the name \u201cF**kface Von Clownstick\u201d like they are so original &amp; like no o\u2026
p1681
aV@ClistonBrown @cenkuygur @POLITICOMag haha completely agree.  This is so stupid.
p1682
aV@benshapiro why are none of your tweets funny?
p1683
aV@benshapiro do you work standup too?  Or just your genius right wing political writing?
p1684
aV@benshapiro that's so funny.  Where do you come up with all this hilarious stuff?  You're great
p1685
aV@scottienhughes would you admit that if he loses Utah or Kansas that he has absolutely no chance of winning nationally?  Tied/losing in both
p1686
aV@scottienhughes ahh cool.  Heard he is drawing around 3-5k per rally these days?  That's really bad, no?
p1687
aV@scottienhughes hi Scottie!  Did you catch that Utah poll where he is tied with Hillary?!
p1688
aV@AnnCoulter @RiversideWeekly this is dumb
p1689
aV@wpjenna what is the capacity of the venue?
p1690
aV@EasterbrookG I'd hope no Fortune 500 CEOs would accept a trump vp gig
p1691
aV@KatyTurNBC huh?  So the politico report was totally wrong?  Odd that the nominee has made no donor calls.  Bizarre...
p1692
aV@FareedZakaria Fareed, would you be willing to ask him this?  And to repeat the question until he answers it?
p1693
aV@AndyRichter @HulkHogan that's how much he gets?  From a bankrupt company?
p1694
aV@Nate_Cohn this is silly.  Locke has been out of the game for a very long time
p1695
aV@andendall greatest are Obama, Gates, Bezos 1/2/3
p1696
aV@HulkHogan what specifically?
p1697
aV@FareedZakaria (which Ryan has admitted...)
p1698
aV@FareedZakaria totally agree.  How can Paul Ryan support a man who makes racist statements?!
p1699
aV@Nate_Cohn as far as sleepers, bob gates &gt; Locke
p1700
aV@jeffbeamish @KatyTurNBC watching now and it is awesome.
p1701
aV@KatyTurNBC @SamSamK007 haha you mean "Kiann" is wrong about something?  No way
p1702
aV@maggieNYT I know
p1703
aV@christinaperri you have any tours coming up?
p1704
aV@maggieNYT so he acknowledged a fact?  And that's news?
p1705
aV@larry_kudlow @OrganicTory Larry are you still supporting Trump?
p1706
aV@AlexisinNH @BillKristol agree with the LOL
p1707
aV@heytana what's going on with these latest polls?  They are absolutely horrendous!!
p1708
aV@AlexisinNH ummm he used a gun?
p1709
aV@jonallendc @nytimes ok but how many diplomats support the status quo?
p1710
aV@KatrinaNation for someone advocating a 50 state strategy, Bernie certainly didn't have one
p1711
aV@StephensWSJ interesting although curious re % of diplomats that support the status quo
p1712
aV@cd_hooks @jmartNYT no Paul O'Neill?!
p1713
aV@wpjenna makes sense given the GOP's 32% approval rating
p1714
aV@JDiamond1  makes sense given the current approval ratings of the GOP
p1715
aV@scottienhughes he should post those polls to his Twitter!  He used to do that but stopped for some weird reason...
p1716
aV@scottienhughes he got 29% nationally in the latest Reuters poll.  Wow, that is historically bad...
p1717
aV@scottienhughes his latest polls have been absolutely terrible
p1718
aV@AlexisinNH @FoxNews @NancyPelosi why is that moronic?
p1719
aV@jonfavs @ericawerner heroic soldier yes but honestly his career as a senator has been anything but dignified
p1720
aV@AlexisinNH you see the latest Reuters poll?  Trump at 29% nationally.  Ouch
p1721
aV@Neil_Irwin 1
p1722
aV@JonahNRO @LMandrakeJr @Morning_Joe she's spent the past year laughing that a guy like Trump could be that party's standard-bearer
p1723
aV@ChrisCuomo @FirebabySandy @CNNResponder but why not drastically limit that right?
p1724
aV@stuartpstevens @SopanDeb any chance Trump quits at some point?  We all know he doesn't want to lose a landslide to Hillary...
p1725
aV@TheRickWilson @jonfavs any chance he quits the race gracefully at some point?  We all know he doesn't want to lose a landslide...
p1726
aV@realDonaldTrump @jbarro I love his sophisticated legal analysis
p1727
aV@jeremyscahill @thenation great point.  I do think that the "profession" attracts those predisposed to violence but it also nurtures it
p1728
aV@DebraMessing @SenSanders nope we sure don't
p1729
aV@jpodhoretz @FoxNews @EricTrump @ClintonFdn that is hilarious
p1730
aV@paulkrugman what a condescending piece
p1731
aV@paulkrugman just FYI the WSJ editorial board is very critical of you in tomorrow's editorial.  Can't wait for your response!
p1732
aV@trumpaboard ahh ok so Bloomberg is fake, and Trump is real!
p1733
aV@trumpaboard why wouldn't they?
p1734
aV@trumpaboard ahh you mean how 65% of women are confident they will never vote for him?
p1735
aV@jimcramer @MadMoneyOnCNBC great exchange.  But doesn't Wilson have a point that LULU has vastly underperformed over the past 5 years?
p1736
aV@benshapiro Umm, no he never said that.
p1737
aV@mitchellvii nope.  Because he can't fill a 20k seat arena anymore
p1738
aV@mitchellvii there were 5k people there.  He was getting 20k during the primaries
p1739
aV@mitchellvii what do you make of the shrinking crowds at his rallies?
p1740
aV@heytana Only 5,000 at last night's rally?  That's terrible...
p1741
aV@ChrisCuomo so what?  Is that an argument for keeping them legal?
p1742
aV@BillKristol not gonna happen.
p1743
aV@heytana  @DanScavino did he insult our veterans yesterday??
p1744
aV@heytana @realDonaldTrump @Veteran4Trump Tana what do you think of the latest Bloomberg poll?  Looks terrible!
p1745
aV@heytana @realDonaldTrump @Veteran4Trump https://t.co/2T5RnSSXPv
p1746
aV@BillKristol oh, they won't
p1747
aV@jbarro hilarious/great point Josh
p1748
aV@betsypearce @YOUNGFiREBRAND https://t.co/2T5RnSSXPv
p1749
aV@chopkins615 @linderje @CNN meron?
p1750
aV@linderje @CNN I did, and then I read his comments today on Obama "prioritizing our enemy over our allies," which validate the Post
p1751
aV@linderje @CNN what was dishonest about it?
p1752
aV@betsypearce @IngrahamAngle @kausmickey what are you even talking about?  Check out today's Bloomberg poll
p1753
aV@JohnJHarwood unreal
p1754
aV@mitchellvii @mcphersonfamily then why was Trump citing polls on a nightly basis starting last August?
p1755
aV@charlescwcooke highly accurate I'm sure.
p1756
aV@ajraspanti @kayleighmcenany ahh right.  Then I wonder why Trump was citing them nightly a year ago?
p1757
aV@brianstelter Would he have supported stronger background checks for the Orlando shooter?
p1758
aV@brianstelter What is his stance on gay marriage?
p1759
aV@brianstelter He has advocated punishing the families of terrorists.  Does he think the Orlando shooter's family should be punished?
p1760
aV@ajraspanti @kayleighmcenany https://t.co/2T5RnSSXPv
p1761
aV@kayleighmcenany https://t.co/2T5RnSSXPv
p1762
aV@wpjenna He said there were 9-10k in audience.  So I'm guessing that means around 5k?
p1763
aV@wpjenna what is the approximate size of the crowd?
p1764
aV@JDiamond1 what is the approximate crowd size at the rally?
p1765
aV@scottienhughes Any comment on the latest Bloomberg poll?
p1766
aVhttps://t.co/2T5RnSSXPv
p1767
aV@scottienhughes https://t.co/2T5RnSSXPv
p1768
aV@charlescwcooke @NoWayGray I don't know which is why I'm asking
p1769
aV@charlescwcooke @NoWayGray Im sure you'll say second amendment, which courts agree has limits.  Why not ban AR 15?
p1770
aV@charlescwcooke @NoWayGray I genuinely am curious.  I don't understand the social benefit of the weapon, outside of law enforcement
p1771
aV@charlescwcooke @NoWayGray what is the argument for not banning the AR-15?
p1772
aV@IngrahamAngle @kausmickey when will this be that he "leads in polls"?  He is getting trounced right now.
p1773
aV@scottienhughes so why not remove the violent portions of every religious book?
p1774
aV@scottienhughes wow that is an offensive statement
p1775
aV@scottienhughes how are those national polls looking for Trump?  Why isn't he posting them to his Twitter feed??
p1776
aV@ajraspanti @kayleighmcenany lol...appreciate the expert analysis!
p1777
aV@ajraspanti @kayleighmcenany umm losing by 7 in the second most red state in the US (Kasnas).
p1778
aV@ajraspanti @kayleighmcenany oh I should?  Looks like he's getting trounced in the polls
p1779
aV@kayleighmcenany you still supporting trump?
p1780
aV@ron_fournier @RoostVineyard @matthewjdowd whoa.  The "flaws" here are nowhere near equivalent
p1781
aV@stuartpstevens so would you respect a Hitler supporter?
p1782
aV@jpodhoretz the journalists he's banning are much smarter than him. They will figure it out and it will be fun to watch
p1783
aV@stuartpstevens why do you "respect" those who are trump supporters?!
p1784
aV@charlescwcooke @Alyssa_Milano what's the argument for not banning assault rifles?
p1785
aV@KateMcElheney @Tmgneff still have yet to read a sensible argument against banning these
p1786
aV@SusanSarandon @nickgillespie come on Susan are you really not going to support the dem candidate?
p1787
aV@tmorello @ChrisGarza in fairness speaking as a guy who was at the Bklyn show, it is one hell of a pit experience
p1788
aV@Khanoisseur @hblodget are the incidents as a % of whole greater or less than Muslim % of pop?
p1789
aV@LoganLevkoff @GeorgeTakei thank you both!
p1790
aV@larry_kudlow except there's not a single specific action item in there on how to diminish the problem
p1791
aV@jonfortt @bpnelsn @tobkin the car analogy is so silly.  Benefit from civilians using cars is 1000x more than guns.  Need car to get to work
p1792
aV@RiversideWeekly @BillKristol wow very foul language...
p1793
aV@scottienhughes @aaron_bogue Scotty -- how do you feel about all of Trump's stupid nicknames??
p1794
aV@StingsUSA @AlexisinNH check the latest KS poll.  He's doing great.
p1795
aV@ErinRehman @scottienhughes @orthodoxeia @WilsonSK2AZ @TaraSetmayer @KevBaile huh?
p1796
aV@jonnajarian proper way to spend a Saturday afternoon!
p1797
aV@jonnajarian I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess the latter
p1798
aV@scottienhughes trump talked again today about what college he went to.  Weird
p1799
aV@scottienhughes @orthodoxeia @WilsonSK2AZ @TaraSetmayer @ErinRehman @KevBaile do you agree he's gonna win NY/NJ/CA?  How abt KS??
p1800
aV@junecrotty @scottienhughes @ToddHeadleeAZ @KasraDean @wass_upbro @TaraSetmayer @CNN I'd refer you both to the latest KS poll...
p1801
aV@scottienhughes @jeffhamma @CNN haha...if he's down by 7 in KS right now, don't worry FL won't be neck and neck for long
p1802
aV@jeffhamma @scottienhughes @CNN new Kansas poll is promising for you guys
p1803
aV@stuartpstevens @realDonaldTrump check the new KS poll
p1804
aV@mattyglesias @realDonaldTrump wonder if trump will mention the new KS poll?
p1805
aV@scottienhughes @junecrotty @StormRoaringH2O hahaha!  Yup they're all just waiting for that convention.  They don't know him yet I guess.
p1806
aV@junecrotty @scottienhughes @StormRoaringH2O you see the new Kansas poll??
p1807
aV@scottienhughes @mario_gt500 you see the new Kansas poll?
p1808
aV@nylitgirl he's losing to her in new Kansas poll.  Wow
p1809
aVRT @elizabethforma: No, seriously -- Delete your account. https://t.co/O1u7oc0jAR
p1810
aV@GoalieDad1971 @ChrisCuomo @rmscarabin @NCBenWilliams he's not going to fix that -- he'd likely make it much worse.
p1811
aV@ChrisCuomo @rmscarabin @NCBenWilliams low gdp and wage growth
p1812
aV@benshapiro @RubinReport @Nero Ben u mad?
p1813
aV@AdamPlatt1999 @pinkbunny70 @JoePerticone not sure what's wrong with that statement
p1814
aV@magicsilicon @JohnDingell @realDonaldTrump genius tweet by dingell
p1815
aV@realDonaldTrump @FreemarketSara Wow.  Much less than W in 2000, as a % of voters.  That's embarrassing.
p1816
aV@seanhannity or maybe "Donald Trump's delivers" will be acceptable usage in a Trump regime?  One can hope!
p1817
aV@seanhannity Can you even get the punctuation right in your tweet?
p1818
aV@NateWatkins @kayleighmcenany its really sad.  Doesn't she hold herself out as "smart"?
p1819
aV@Seven_Oaks_ @BillKristol @krauthammer is being a weirdo disqualifying?  Trump is a bigger weirdo btw
p1820
aV@benshapiro Would be so awesome it that was funny
p1821
aV@realDonaldTrump @FreemarketSara 34% in today's Reuters poll??  You should post a link
p1822
aV@NateWatkins @kayleighmcenany hahaha...mcenany should really report the 34% nationwide he got in today's Reuters poll
p1823
aV@BillKristol if trump heads into the convention at 30-35% in the polls (quite possible), it may happen
p1824
aV@mattyglesias @MattWelch what does the "never trump" crowd think of Johnson?
p1825
aV@BillKristol @krauthammer why do you totally ignore the Gary Johnson candidacy?  It's so odd...
p1826
aV@FoxNews @IngrahamAngle you mean racist "reform?"  We'll pass!
p1827
aV@BillKristol what the hell is wrong with Gary Johnson?
p1828
aV@Trader_Moe but why not stop it completely if it cost us $?
p1829
aV@Trader_Moe Sounds like the authoritative source.  What's your solution?  No more immigration?
p1830
aV@kayleighmcenany @foxnewslatino I actually think Trump should post a link to the new Reuters poll that has him at 34% nationally
p1831
aV@AlexisinNH @FoxBusiness what's wrong with accepting 65k refugees?
p1832
aV@CahnEmily @Tristanshouts sounds like some objective journalism
p1833
aVRT @HillaryClinton: Delete your account. https://t.co/Oa92sncRQY
p1834
aV@jodiapplekay @RealMichaelKay hmm.  Is Twitter new?
p1835
aV@jpodhoretz so she's giving Trump an order to restrict his free speech?  Odd...
p1836
aV@10offatlowes @stuartpstevens @bp207crafts as I said, I was talking abt % of total dem votes
p1837
aV@NYTnickc @maggieNYT huh??
p1838
aV@stuartpstevens @bp207crafts and I believe Hillary had the highest % of dems since the 70s...
p1839
aV@SopanDeb @JohnJHarwood I forget, what has Mike Murphy gotten right since this campaign began?
p1840
aV@DogfishBradford @maggieNYT @daveweigel perhaps but I think he'd wait until late in the general to do that.  Why give up leverage over GOP
p1841
aV@maggieNYT @daveweigel why in the world would he do that?
p1842
aV@PaulBegala @AnnCoulter lol
p1843
aV@ochocinco what do you want to do?
p1844
aV@AbbyMartin what are your thoughts on Gary Johnson?
p1845
aV@chrislhayes @aoscott the FX miniseries was also incredible
p1846
aV@cenkuygur how about neither but you just admit that a vote for her at this point is the best way to stop Trump
p1847
aV@cenkuygur do you have a better candidate?
p1848
aV@costareports Trump hasn't tweeted for 20 hrs.  Is that a record for him this campaign?
p1849
aV@BlackAttackHawk @mcphersonfamily what is the theory that he wins?  What states?
p1850
aV@chelseahandler Jessica jones?
p1851
aV@MattMillburn @BillKristol @LiveActionNews does Kristol want it outlawed?  Does he think the woman should be punished?
p1852
aV@MattMillburn @BillKristol @LiveActionNews hmm I don't see him saying he supports abortion
p1853
aV@heytana @WeNeedTrump do you really think he'll win?
p1854
aV@magicsilicon they go away and we start hiring more people w expertise in automation?
p1855
aV@ActionJackson66 @tmorello @prophetsofrage agree but hard to beat tonight in front of 800 people!!
p1856
aV@MattMillburn @BillKristol weird.  Nothing about abortion there.
p1857
aV@ActionJackson66 @tmorello @prophetsofrage total joke how good that show was!!  Insane
p1858
aV@MattMillburn @BillKristol source?
p1859
aV@tmorello @prophetsofrage @whyhunger just got back home.  INSANE show!!!  More please...
p1860
aV@letsgoskatepool @BillKristol @GovGaryJohnson seems like that stupid "never trump" crowd is wired to oppose Hillary, reason be damned
p1861
aV@letsgoskatepool @BillKristol @GovGaryJohnson possibly.  But he has to support him over Hillary right?
p1862
aV@realDonaldTrump @jasian12345 @CNN but you're still watching them a little bit?
p1863
aV@BillKristol what's wrong with Gary Johnson?
p1864
aV@benshapiro so?
p1865
aV@BillKristol not me
p1866
aV@nylitgirl its hilarious that he wants to promote his stupid book but is only asked abt trump
p1867
aV@nylitgirl that meet the press appearance was just sad
p1868
aV@JVLaB @GovGaryJohnson @meetthepress @chucktodd @NBCNews good luck!  Looking forward to watching
p1869
aV@realDonaldTrump @JudgeJeanine @FoxNews how did everything go?
p1870
aV@AlexisinNH she sure does. (Though nowhere near trumps #).  Re B they she gets fact checked in interviews but they should do chyrons too
p1871
aV@AlexisinNH maybe they are but she makes fewer wildly inaccurate statements?
p1872
aV@andygawt @morningmoneyben GOP not finished yet but doesn't look good given Trumps disastrous past week
p1873
aV@andygawt @morningmoneyben scary thing is that a lot can go wrong in a 2 person race and he could win.
p1874
aV@andygawt @morningmoneyben it is amazing.  Seems like a lot of GOPers could wind up discredited after this, starting w Ryan
p1875
aV@andygawt @morningmoneyben agree generally.  Though major q abt McCain considering he now supports a racist.
p1876
aV@andygawt @morningmoneyben so should we not delegitimize those who now support the racist GOP candidate?
p1877
aV@andygawt @morningmoneyben agree re them not being racist extremists.  My main Q is who Ben would consider legitimate in today's GOP
p1878
aV@andygawt @morningmoneyben not sure how a guy who picks Palin as VP is "legitimate"
p1879
aV@AlexisinNH @BIZPACReview should they not correct Trump's lies?
p1880
aV@DebraMessing @Tristanshouts @EL2397 I'm genuinely curious what Debra thinks of the countless scandals.  All ok?
p1881
aV@amayasays he passed away?
p1882
aV@douglasmintz @morningmoneyben Romney was legitimate and lost.  Still waiting to hear who, this year, would be a "legitimate" GOP candidate
p1883
aV@douglasmintz @morningmoneyben not to mention the Sarah palin pick.  Guy was never really legitimate.
p1884
aV@douglasmintz @morningmoneyben McCain is legitimate despite now supporting a racist?  Yikes
p1885
aV@bobkohn @RandyEBarnett trump hasnt spent a day in his life in govt and advocates war crimes, "opening" libel laws, and doubting judiciary
p1886
aV@bobkohn @RandyEBarnett are you serious Bob?  Yes she is better.  Has functioned within government institutions successfully for yrs
p1887
aV@morningmoneyben Trump is the party.  The party supports Trump.  Still wondering who those "legitimate" candidates would be.
p1888
aV@andygawt @morningmoneyben not sure where these GOP "legitimate" candidates can be found, but I guess Sasse makes 1.
p1889
aV@andygawt @morningmoneyben the Congressional leader is now supporting a man who is objectively a racist.  McCain also has expressed support
p1890
aV@morningmoneyben so who would the legitimate candidate be?
p1891
aV@morningmoneyben no, that party is totally incapable of producing a "legitimate" candidate.
p1892
aV@DebraMessing @ABCLiz pretty sure he's not a good businessman actually
p1893
aV@DebraMessing @westratenick any concern re her scandals, or no?
p1894
aV@ananavarro great trump comments today.  Congrats on bravely standing up to him!  As a fellow lawyer I agree the judge comments cross a line
p1895
aV@rschles @neeratanden wonder what he thinks of Trump's 35% nationally in latest Reuters poll
p1896
aV@larry_kudlow @LarryKudlowShow @newtgingrich trump is at 35% in the latest national Reuters poll.  You guys still big supporters?
p1897
aV@greta @NYTNational @CoryBooker couldn't the "they" be referring to the figure and Booker?  Rather than the figure him/herself?
p1898
aV@LMandrakeJr @chrislhayes fundamental right to throw eggs?
p1899
aV@jpodhoretz @terryteachout why 1958?  Great life expectancy?  Or was it the world peace?
p1900
aV@jpodhoretz @terryteachout that is so dumb
p1901
aV@chrislhayes umm yeah and your point is?  Fundamental right to throw eggs?
p1902
aV@jpodhoretz and you'd like that?
p1903
aV@therealMJK1776 @BretBaier @CondoleezzaRice @realDonaldTrump lol.  Zero chance she'd accept
p1904
aV@Chet_Cannon @NBCNightlyNews @Jacobnbc right Chet, it's the Trump supporters who are totally reasonable, right?
p1905
aV@KatyTurNBC @Jacobnbc nothing is happening
p1906
aV@KatyTurNBC @Jacobnbc oh come on
p1907
aV@maggieNYT is that newsworthy for some reason?
p1908
aV@AriFleischer she hasn't, but she's giving a fantastic speech.  Makes a lot more sense than anything Trump has said on FP
p1909
aV@ayanaeliza @UnderTheGunDoc @PvblicF source for this?
p1910
aV@morningmoneyben @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump what?  Trump said something untrue???!
p1911
aV@AlecuRussell @EdwardGLuce This states that Trump got the highest % of vote in Buchanan county.  Not accurate -- it was Staten Island
p1912
aV@clmazin yeah but bernie also polls better v trump in MI/OH/PA which are crucial for electoral college
p1913
aV@jonfavs @chrislhayes but wouldn't brexit and the Thiel thing be covered by cable news?
p1914
aV@stuartpstevens @djgm50 @realDonaldTrump @LukeRussert but what is your conclusion?  That's what he's asking
p1915
aV@JohnJHarwood from a reporting perspective, what is the theory behind retweeting all of trumps tweets?
p1916
aV@jimcramer @pjj16 great q.  Personal top 3:  1) Schultz; 2) Dimon; 3) Nadella
p1917
aV@stuartpstevens @teddyschleifer can't you please just get Mitt to run??
p1918
aV@DebraMessing @Jonathan_Saker wait so you think Hill is a better candidate v Trump?  Seriously??
p1919
aV@larry_kudlow @batchelorshow come on Larry!  How about immigration, minority outreach, federal debt, and virtually all foreign policy??
p1920
aV@IanSams @PaulBegala guess it must be true?
p1921
aV@GovGaryJohnson @Montel_Williams @AC360 @LucidJonFranks @LPNational good luck Gary!!!  Looking forward to watching the campaign
p1922
aV@nickgillespie @realDonaldTrump @BillKristol @LPNational @GovGaryJohnson why does he only have 160k Twitter followers?
p1923
aV@davidfickling @pmarca @CHSommers @NBCNews what?  Hasn't she indicated she doesn't want to debate?
p1924
aV@BuzzFeedAndrew @secupp not a trump supporter but curious what the theory is on the newsworthiness of quotes from 12 yrs ago right now
p1925
aV@Cruellaphile @Austan_Goolsbee hilarious.  Love how the commenter also points out that a 46 yr old shouldn't talk abt a 70 yr old (?)
p1926
aV@NastiaLiukin @ShawnJohnson @DancingABC @AndrewDEast @matt_lombardi @Doxified what show even is this?
p1927
aV@Ron11366 @JWKeady he dislikes Christie and trump.  You really need more?!
p1928
aV@JWKeady I wish my Twitter following (110 people) was that effective!  Working on my "real" friends however....
p1929
aV@JWKeady already gave $100!  Let me know where to go for the next fundraiser/event
p1930
aV@jonfavs @IAMWillBeck how bout Huntsman as hills vp choice?
p1931
aV@LeeAnnMcAdoo what is it??
p1932
aV@stuartpstevens hey stu -- what are your thoughts on Gary Johnson?  I'm curious!
p1933
aV@danpfeiffer @jonfavs @jbouie has this worked at all??  Trump led Hillary nationally in a poll released today
p1934
aV@CharlesMBlow @ListenThinkSay also that arg doesn't factor in what the negative ads would be like if kasich/bern were the frontrunner
p1935
aV@mattyglesias yeah but GOP is unified.  Look at GOP congressmen opposing Trump.  Count on one hand.
p1936
aV@ForecasterEnten @jbarro why is it over?  Superdelegates won't vote for the person with the better polls v trump?
p1937
aV@mattyglesias so does American idiot
p1938
aV@BillKristol maybe it's time to jump to the gary johnson camp rather than search for non-existent conservatives to run?
p1939
aV@JustinPulitzer people are hooped up?  You wouldn't know it from the markets reaction...
p1940
aV@cher @ninatypewriter who was the guy?
p1941
aV@DebraMessing @PaulBegala is hill gonna release those transcripts?  Or the list of Clinton foundation donors?
p1942
aV@mattyglesias have you heard her speak?
p1943
aV@SullyCNBC then who makes the robots??
p1944
aV@carlquintanilla won't we still need people to make the robots?
p1945
aV@charlescwcooke I don't know abt "high" but aren't they similar to Reagans at this point in his term?
p1946
aV@davidfrum @jonathanweisman unless interest rates are low enough where your expected roi is higher
p1947
aV@alisonstewart @JessicaJones no kidding, right??  Especially fun for NY-ers...
p1948
aV@NateSilver538 huh?  This makes no sense.  2 became pres
p1949
aV@BenSasse can't wait to read it!!
p1950
aV@BenSasse Happy you are in the Senate, sir!  Keep up the great work.
p1951
aV@KenGardner11 @SeanTrende ever hear of a social moderate converting Dems?
p1952
aV@KenGardner11 @SeanTrende Ken, this is totally wrong
p1953
aV@AlexRubalcava @magicsilicon what was the question??
p1954
aV@RumsfeldOffice out of curiosity, who are you supporting for President?
p1955
aV@clmazin @rilaws Yesterday you mentioned Cruz didn't listen to music.  What abt movies?  Any favorites?
p1956
aV@davidfrum such as??
p1957
aV@cenkuygur @Vampire1812 how exactly would that happen?  It's abt 99% certain Trump v Hillary
p1958
aV@mviser did she also say he bet on the game?  Weird
p1959
aV@MrChrisMoon @morningmoneyben Guess I'm giving a bit more weight to votes now then to votes cast in Feb when 10 other people were in.
p1960
aV@MrChrisMoon @morningmoneyben weird, I noticed around 60% in 5 states last night
p1961
aV@morningmoneyben he uses the next 6 months to convince them to vote for him.  He has a good track record of getting votes thus far...
p1962
aV@clmazin @Rich_Bobbe he already gave it preemptively and screwed up some line from Hoosiers:  https://t.co/OyTU6zu0g6
p1963
aV@ianbremmer @tylercowen fascinating.  Source?
p1964
aV@MarkHalperin @PaulBegala unemployment was around 7.5% and rising in '92.  Far cry from today...
p1965
aV@R_Thaler @nytpolitics @alexburnsNYT @mattfleg @jmartNYT (cooperation)
p1966
aV@R_Thaler @nytpolitics @alexburnsNYT @mattfleg @jmartNYT Great point professor Thaler.  Also when you do it abt 6 weeks too late!
p1967
aV@cenkuygur hill will need to pick a far left VP.  Bern or Warren I guess?
p1968
aV@benshapiro lol
p1969
aV@stuartpstevens sadly this plan won't work at all
p1970
aV@clmazin @joejaegerguitar Craig man, it's over.  Cruz will run again I'm sure but zero shot in 2016
p1971
aV@morningmoneyben @realDonaldTrump @monicalangley actually seems to be working pretty well.
p1972
aV@charlescwcooke are you implying that it's the wrong decision?
p1973
aV@benshapiro who funds you again?
p1974
aV@PaulBegala @jaketapper @HillaryClinton @SenSanders yes bc Dems actually vote in primaries
p1975
aV@jpodhoretz huh?  Wrong...https://t.co/glJ3QmRMRp
p1976
aV@nohilary @benshapiro hilarious that a person would pay Ben Shapiro money to run a website.  bwahahahahah
p1977
aV@nohilary @benshapiro lol you serious?  Benny gets by on Cruz $?  Man that hurts his credibility just a tad...
p1978
aV@Redistrict vote totals?
p1979
aV@nohilary @benshapiro haha who are the wilks bros?
p1980
aV@photofather1 @SmallBiz4Trump what are you even talking about?
p1981
aV@Izengabe_ @stuartpstevens haha wrong!  Cultural vote in UT; economic vote in OH/PA; familiarity vote in FL
p1982
aV@benshapiro lol.  Ben, how much longer till you give in and vote trump?  We all know it's coming!
p1983
aV@Izengabe_ @stuartpstevens true.  He'll win MS and won't miss UT's electorals...especially after winning FL/OH/PA
p1984
aV@stuartpstevens I am sure you know more abt this but im just looking at 1) FL primary vote totals; 2) Hilary's ineptitude as a campaigner
p1985
aV@stuartpstevens Dems would do well to accept this now and defend OH and PA
p1986
aV@stuartpstevens trump is a total lock to beat Hillary in FL.
p1987
aV@SmallBiz4Trump How embarrassing is it that Trump lost Manhattan?  Seriously.
p1988
aV@SmallBiz4Trump actually, using "logic" and "Trump" in the same sentence just doesn't make sense.  I'll stop.
p1989
aV@SmallBiz4Trump oh bernie's my candidate?  Another great example of Trump logic!
p1990
aV@AnnCoulter LOL.  Maybe Rove has a slot somewhere?
p1991
aV@SmallBiz4Trump haha.  Did Trump ever work in Manhattan?  I forget.
p1992
aV@nickshippers @CharlesMBlow np w 'letting' them do whatever they want as long as they realize each day makes a trump presidency more likely
p1993
aV@Bethenny no one is talking NY election here?!
p1994
aV@nickshippers @CharlesMBlow yeah but that's over now.  It's a distraction which diverts attention from confronting Trump.
p1995
aV@davidaxelrod nah, we NY'ers have never been that into televangelists.
p1996
aV@CharlesMBlow his campaign manager just said on msnbc that they are staying in till the convention.  Helpful.
p1997
aV@mmurraypolitics @ABswl16 this sounds like really important news
p1998
aV@DefendWallSt just zero chance of that
p1999
aV@GovGaryJohnson go Gary!  Hey, what's with the only 140k twitter followers??
p2000
aV@Nate_Cohn I don't get it.  Why were there zero delegates?
p2001
aV@RBReich where do you get your 3.4% growth #?!
p2002
aV@businessinsider no link to an article or the guy's name here.  Why should we care again?
p2003
aV@benshapiro @ben_geier @Montel_Williams Ben, who is your favorite band?
p2004
aV@benshapiro who are your favorite bands?
p2005
aV@Lagarde why are IMF growth projections continually overestimated, year after year?  Why not underestimate and revise upward?
p2006
aV@MarkMcIntosh26 @clmazin right.  World would go on and it's also a horrendous idea
p2007
aV@clmazin @MarkMcIntosh26 vast majority of economists disagree that gold standard makes any sense whatsoever anymore
p2008
aV@clmazin @MarkMcIntosh26 lol hilarious how this guy picks a sample set from 100 yrs ago
p2009
aV@pmarca @BuzzFeedNews wonder what that's supposed to mean?
p2010
aV@Forbes you guys going to provide a source or should we just take your word for it?
p2011
aV@JonahNRO @TrumpsArmy @BillKristol @rupertmurdoch they're right.  Trump will be the nom -- enough people are tiring of resistance
p2012
aV@KristNovoselic @RobertTrujillo @RasputinRecords from one legend to another!  Love it
p2013
aV@Forbes could you please provide a source for this?
p2014
aV@Forbes this sounds like it can't be true.  Number seems way too high to be plausible.
p2015
aV@CharlesMBlow she seemed really slow tonight
p2016
aV@CharlesMBlow @YahooTopNews what is your read on this Charles?
p2017
aV@KatrinaNation when will you just admit that sanders' policies are shit?
p2018
aV@anthonyweiner off topic but I'm watching the debate.  Why is Bernie still in this?
p2019
aV@bohemiantoo @danpfeiffer it's a hell of a lot better than Bernies dumb ideas
p2020
aV@wizardstatus916 @jeremyscahill @BernieSanders you're totally wrong
p2021
aV@danpfeiffer he's a total nuisance.  Why don't Dems just admit this?
p2022
aV@LukeRussert @DanaBashCNN her follow ups were terrible but ok
p2023
aV@jeremyscahill Hillary won by a mile.  90% of Sanders' ideas are just completely senseless
p2024
aV@cenkuygur @SenSanders they should be defended before the Israelis?
p2025
aV@realjoeyfatone @ashleyiaco @LanceBass how old is Fatone again?
p2026
aV@davidaxelrod Bernie is so full of it.  Wish you Dems would call him out
p2027
aV@LindsayT they are one reason.  I can go down the list naming other cruel oil-producing dictatorships...
p2028
aV@LindsayT they don't let women drive.  Why don't we stop importing oil from them altogether?  Better idea to me than banning fracking
p2029
aV@BernieSanders Bernie supports getting more oil from Saudi Arabia I guess?!
p2030
aV@LindsayT can you point me to evidence that fracking is harmful to the env?  Re 2 we are reliant to the extent we import oil from them
p2031
aV@LindsayT my interest is that it 1) makes gas cheaper; 2) reduces our reliance on cruel dictatorships and 3) provides a ton of jobs
p2032
aV@LindsayT @nickconfessore yeah,  because of fracking!  Which he wants to ban
p2033
aV@ReformedBroker what were her big legislative achievements?
p2034
aV@LindsayT @nickconfessore huh?  Why not?
p2035
aV@nickconfessore ask Bernie if Apple and Facebook are as "bad" as GE and Verizon?
p2036
aV@nickconfessore ask Bernie if we ban fracking where does he want to get the oil?  Saudi Arabia, who abuses women?
p2037
aV@nickconfessore how do they explain Obama having an identical approval rating to Reagan at this point in his term?
p2038
aV@nickconfessore what jobs will they create?  What sectors will they be in?  How much lower than 5% will the unemployment rate go?
p2039
aV@nickconfessore what city(s) would they put US troops in to stop Isis?  How many troops?
p2040
aV@nickconfessore can they provide logical defense of not prosecuting mothers for taking of life in abortions?
p2041
aV@nickconfessore what do they think of the recent study that said deporting all illegals would cost $500b?
p2042
aVRT @tmorello: Please support @JWKeady's run for Congress. Former @RATM Freedom Fighter of the Month alum! Real deal. Give at https://t.co/X\u2026
p2043
aV@cenkuygur @Salon this is ridiculous.  It's not hypocrisy to advocate different solutions for different countries
p2044
aVRT @JWKeady: To the 150k members of @CWADistrict1, #KEADYFORCONGRESS has your back. #StandUp2Vz https://t.co/2sYWrXlcQx @CWAUnion https://t\u2026
p2045
aVRT @JWKeady: Thanks for the support @tmorello. Let's rage #KEADYFORCONGRESS right to Capitol Hill! @johnsb01 @MattFriedmanNJ  https://t.co/\u2026
p2046
aV@tmorello @JWKeady @RATM thanks Tom.  as an NJ native son, I'd love to!  He seems great
p2047
aV@greta then why charge? (Ps I'm a lawyer w ounce of experience)
p2048
aV@secupp this is so stupid
p2049
aV@secupp wonder what your criteria of 'everything' is?  Kind of shudder to think abt it actually...
p2050
aV@happydance04 @secupp lol how so?
p2051
aV@SSifferlin @Bethenny @Bravotv lol.  In other words cruel entertainment I guess
p2052
aV@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump he thinks we're 'paying' for Japan even though they are subsidizing our troops.  But I'm sure you asked him right?
p2053
aV@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump so deep!
p2054
aV@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump lol.  Trump has been around since the early 80's
p2055
aV@laceylocke1987 @DuffMcKagan @coachella nah I hear he's solid and ready to play...
p2056
aV@laceylocke1987 @DuffMcKagan @coachella hah.  Or how bout "Where's Sorum?"
p2057
aV@MarkHalperin @SpikeLee @BernieSanders weird picture
p2058
aV@DuffMcKagan @coachella nice!  Where's Adler?
p2059
aV@maggieNYT @politico who cares?
p2060
aV@JonahNRO @PaulBegala @KatrinaNation this is so silly.  Does she actually think any of sanders' ideas are at all realistic?
p2061
aV@KatrinaNation are you in favor of banning all fracking like Bernie is?
p2062
aV@KatrinaNation could it be because his ideas are completely senseless?
p2063
aV@benshapiro thanks, guy who went to law school!!
p2064
aV@larry_kudlow @batchelorshow market near record highs, unemployment near record lows, and GDP growth better under Obama than W!
p2065
aV@Bethenny @BrianaLG were you the first person to ever say that?
p2066
aV@FreeJesseJames honest?  About what?
p2067
aV@stephenfhayes @RalstonReports @GovSandoval trump will be the nom guys
p2068
aV@JordanChariton @TheYoungTurks he's right.  Our whole electoral system is based on checking majority (see electoral college)
p2069
aV@levie ha nice!  Did Zuck respond??
p2070
aV@ochocinco @fitspeedAP what do you weigh now?
p2071
aV@MariaBartiromo @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness why is this news?!
p2072
aV@Angry_Husky @ChrisCuomo happens all the time in private organizations, and works great.
p2073
aV@BritishBerner @BernieSanders Bernie will confer a huge benefit on the Saudis by banning fracking.  Thanks Bern!
p2074
aV@BritishBerner @BernieSanders cool.  Guess you don't drive to work
p2075
aV@ChrisCuomo @Angry_Husky exactly Chris.  What's fair is letting private organizations (aka political parties) do as they please re rules
p2076
aV@BritishBerner @BernieSanders so I guess it's preferable to import more oil from backwards dictatorships like Saudi Arabia?  #campaign2016
p2077
aV@krikaworks @GregoryJBarber where would you suggest getting the oil from instead?  Saudi Arabia?
p2078
aV@taddevine so I guess you'd rather purchase more oil from abusive dictatorships like Saudi Arabia?
p2079
aV@benshapiro @gatewaypundit no, Kasich will beat Cruz in NY/NJ/PA/MD, Possibly more
p2080
aV@DaveMustaine @rocklucho Dave have you endorsed/plan to endorse anyone in the US presidential race?
p2081
aV@JonahNRO sounds like a sophisticated legal analysis
p2082
aV@quintywinties why not??
p2083
aV@benshapiro @AnnCoulter lol.  It definitely doesn't matter as much in a primary election as in a general.  Rules are rules!
p2084
aV@davidfrum @RJC was it his plan to deport all illegals, or to abolish the IRS?
p2085
aV@marycmccormack @chelseahandler wow. When was that?!
p2086
aV@benshapiro @AnnCoulter are you actually trying to use logic v a trump argument?
p2087
aV@tomgreenlive no but we probably could be if we ramped up drilling
p2088
aV@tomgreenlive what are your impressions of him firsthand?
p2089
aV@crampell in fairness I'm pretty sure men get attacked just as much for being ambitious (see Ted Cruz)
p2090
aV@tomgreenlive is this true?  If so hilarious.  Source???
p2091
aV@kulturtod @mattyglesias I'll check the taibbi piece at some pt but I don't get why an ARM is hard to understand.  Can they check Wikipedia?
p2092
aV@kulturtod @mattyglesias mortgages aren't that complex if someone takes an hr or two to research
p2093
aV@kulturtod @mattyglesias so if the loans weren't reasonable why did the borrowers take them?
p2094
aV@MacMargi @billmaher talking abt majority NOW not 2 months ago.  Check latest polls!
p2095
aV@kulturtod @mattyglesias seems high 3's on a 30yr seems pretty reasonable to me
p2096
aV@kulturtod @mattyglesias so what's an "affordable loan"?  One that doesn't need to be paid back?
p2097
aV@MacMargi @billmaher hah meaning the majority of the dem party?
p2098
aV@kulturtod @mattyglesias actually NINJA loans were
p2099
aV@kulturtod @mattyglesias does Bern not realize rates are near record lows?
p2100
aV@mattyglesias @SenSanders guess he doesn't follow interest rates?
p2101
aV@SenSanders loans aren't affordable right now??
p2102
aV@ryandowney 5 albums counting lies and spaghetti incident.  Yes lots of covers in there
p2103
aV@ryandowney they have at least 150 if you add up all the gnr albums counting post-slash
p2104
aV@AriFleischer they don't mind his absurd policy proposals?  Abolish IRS and deport all illegals?
p2105
aV@hblodget @RobertBryan4 our economy is weak?
p2106
aV@AbbyMartin what would be worse, covering his campaign or trumps?
p2107
aV@aaroncorey @cenkuygur @PaulBegala @paulkrugman fair point.  The characterization of Lehman as a "shadow bank" is off base
p2108
aV@cenkuygur @PaulBegala @paulkrugman @SenSanders what is false?  Krugman seems right on the money to me
p2109
aV@jonsteinberg https://t.co/1ivE5RB9v5
p2110
aV@jonsteinberg there was a nice WSJ piece on this a few weeks ago.  They are apparently at capacity and simply can't run more trains
p2111
aV@JonahNRO @EricTrump actually, Furio is from Italy
p2112
aV@DebraMessing hmm is it really?
p2113
aV@KenGardner11 I actually think this is a likely outcome.  There are plenty gop'era out there who would receive wider agreement than tr/cr
p2114
aV@nylitgirl lol.  After reading the daily news intvw I'm not so sure he has a great answer for that
p2115
aVThere is an entire MLB regular season and playoffs before the general election happens.  Mind-blowing. #Election2016 #WisconsinPrimary
p2116
aV@KellyO @ApprenticeNBC @heytana still no correction on a factually inaccurate statement?  Wow
p2117
aV@tmorello FYI Disturbed just covered Killing in the Name at Irving plaza.  Nothing beats ratm but they did it justice.  (the floor shook)
p2118
aV@KenGardner11 Absolutely disgusting!!
p2119
aV@KenGardner11 looks like the tweet is down.  What did it say?
p2120
aV@katiepack @stuartpstevens @DaveMc99TA as I said there's room for improvement but Obama approval % around where Reagans was at this point
p2121
aV@stuartpstevens @DaveMc99TA agree there's still plenty of work to be done but claiming the economy is bad is simply inaccurate
p2122
aV@stuartpstevens @DaveMc99TA and I mean smart repubs, not trump repubs
p2123
aV@stuartpstevens @DaveMc99TA maybe repubs should admit Obama has done a nice job on the economy.  Vast majority of economists agree.
p2124
aV@stuartpstevens @DaveMc99TA correct re stock ownership so I guess market irrelevant?  Wow, great news for last 2 republican presidents
p2125
aV@stuartpstevens @DaveMc99TA hmm.  Curious when 'most jobs' have been high wage
p2126
aV@stuartpstevens @DaveMc99TA anyway my point is that your original statement re economy was simply false
p2127
aV@stuartpstevens @DaveMc99TA not sure what 'mood of country' is but near-record high stock market and 5% unemployment are decent indicators
p2128
aV@stuartpstevens @DaveMc99TA unemployment has gone from 10 to 5%, and GDP growth stronger under Obama than bush.  Enough said!!
p2129
aV@stuartpstevens @DaveMc99TA it's just nuts to equate this with a weak economy.  Yes modest loss in factory jobs.  No, sky is not falling
p2130
aV@stuartpstevens @DaveMc99TA republicans
p2131
aV@stuartpstevens @DaveMc99TA you guys try so hard to be taken seriously but always ruin it with silly statements like this!!
p2132
aV@stuartpstevens @DaveMc99TA seriously, what are you even talking about?  Genuinely curious where you get this stuff
p2133
aV@stuartpstevens @DaveMc99TA stu you can't be serious.  Lower unemployment, higher stock market, higher PMI, higher wage growth
p2134
aV@ConanOBrien wow.  Isn't Clinton 6'2"?  You're a giant!!
p2135
aV@heytana @realDonaldTrump if he's pro life why would he oppose punishing a woman who gets an abortion?
p2136
aV@heytana just out of curiosity what did you think of that whole abortion thing last week??
p2137
aV@kayleighmcenany wait Kayleigh I thought he wanted to punish women who had the procedure?  What happened??!!
p2138
aV@ReformedBroker hilarious coming from a guy who sold millions of copies of a book on financial advice despite hving zero financial backgrnd
p2139
aV@stuartpstevens @CLewandowski_ not a trump guy but thats a terrible burn
p2140
aV@RonBrownstein (all 3 states)
p2141
aV@RonBrownstein yeah but smart people live in both states and they realize trump is imploding.
p2142
aV@pmarca @BNAustralia is the VC industry a coin flipping industry, too?  Or just hedge funds?
p2143
aV@KristinCav just talk abt Justin Bobby
p2144
aV@GuyKawasaki agree!  draiman has some serious pipes
p2145
aV@KatyTurNBC bizarre letter.  So I guess he can release pre-2009 returns, since they are no longer under audit?
p2146
aV@KellyO no correction here to make it accurate?
p2147
aV@KatyTurNBC it's merely a letter.  No returns Katy...
p2148
aV@KatyTurNBC what?  i don't see any returns there...
p2149
aV@charlescwcooke he also really likes, "I change all the time.  I'm a businessman.  That's what we do!"
p2150
aV@KellyO I think she was actually a contestant but not winner
p2151
aV@RichLowry wait trump said something untrue?  This could really be a scandal...
p2152
aV@cenkuygur this is almost Palin-esque
p2153
aV@RichLowry and an "honest" guy
p2154
aV@DColtonNow @ninatypewriter it really is amazing.  This is almost Palin-Esque
p2155
aV@joshrogin @JonahNRO addressing any of trump's claims logically seems utterly pointless by now
p2156
aV@NKingofDC lol.  Wow that gaffe was Palin-esque.  For some reason his voters won't care though.
p2157
aV@CharlesMBlow why the hell don't the interviewers ever say excuse me back?!
p2158
aV@peterbakernyt @JeffreyGoldberg so he is saying he was misquoted?
p2159
aV@RiversideWeekly @stuartpstevens @ChrisFiorentino @greta @AnnCoulter @ananavarro where did Navarro say that?
p2160
aV@jonfavs totally wrong.  For one thing it's looking less and less like Trump will be the nominee.
p2161
aV@csoghoian @pmarca we get it Marc.  Hillary is flawed.  Got a better candidate?
p2162
aV@rickyftw @mikeshinoda haha.  Totally agree.
p2163
aV@MarkHalperin care to give any specifics?
p2164
aV@jeremyscahill one of his other "advisors" is 28 yrs old and cites Model UN as a qualification
p2165
aV@RichLowry @realDonaldTrump exactly.  If anything, the fractured field was "unfair" to Cruz, who is gaining in polls as it shrinks
p2166
aV@JonahNRO @mtracey you will support Trump.  What month do you think you'll come around to endorsing him? I say August
p2167
aV@stuartpstevens didn't you once predict he wouldn't win a primary?
p2168
aV@JonahNRO Funny that you guys still think that though
p2169
aV@JonahNRO LOL.  Zero chance Trump doesn't get to 1237
p2170
aV@charlescwcooke how long before you come around and vote for Trump?
p2171
aV@stuartpstevens @alexburnsNYT @MittRomney mitt got 60m votes in 2012.  His approval is probably higher than Hillary or trump.  Why not run??
p2172
aV@JPeterDonald @tedcruz what a great statement.  Thank you Mr. Donald!
p2173
aV@Newsmax_Media @rickungar @NewsmaxTV he won't lose Utah
p2174
aV@KenGardner11 who cares about the baseball game?  Let him watch a game.  Doesn't matter at all.
p2175
aV@TheZapper3 @ScottWapnerCNBC @ReformedBroker sounds nuts but underrated
p2176
aV@ScottWapnerCNBC @ReformedBroker shak, in and out, MCD, BareBurger, 5 Guys
p2177
aV@thecenterpiece1 @anthonyweiner @BuzzFeedAndrew logic definitely doesn't
p2178
aV@allthedaynight @TheYoungTurks I'm sure he'd go on if he knew what it was...
p2179
aV@jbarro @JWGOP mitt could be the guy for this.  Say what you want but his approval has to be better than trump/hill (27/37%)
p2180
aV@NKingofDC lol.  So mount an all out offensive, after we re-institute the draft? Cool!
p2181
aV@JohnLegere John -- thank you for your valuable insights!
p2182
aV@anthonyweiner @BuzzFeedAndrew do fact checks matter in the age of Trump?
p2183
aV@ReformedBroker true but misleading.  plenty of crimes are way down.  https://t.co/i0uVjjZFe4
p2184
aV@jbarro well said Josh.
p2185
aV@RichLowry Cruz knows stuff?  Umm you wouldn't know it by looking at his immigration plan or "abolish the IRS" stance
p2186
aV@DouthatNYT has trump weighed in on garland yet?
p2187
aV@NateSilver538 has trump weighed in on garland yet?
p2188
aV@BuzzFeedBen has trump commented on Garland yet?
p2189
aV@JonahNRO has trump spoken out re garland?
p2190
aV@davidaxelrod should have happened at least 20 yrs ago
p2191
aV@stephenfhayes it's really weird indeed
p2192
aV@stuartpstevens so?
p2193
aV@SimonMaloy @pinkbunny70 lol yup.  Pretty sure he drew the memo for the Jeb campaign.  And the W one.
p2194
aV@DouthatNYT LOL...and what would that involve???
p2195
aV@maggieNYT @alexburnsNYT @BillKristol perhaps a 3rd party candidate could win enough states to deny a 270 majority to the others?
p2196
aVRT @BarackObama: Retweet if you believe Judge Merrick Garland deserves fair consideration. #DoYourJobFriday https://t.co/NYvoxcFO8H
p2197
aV@DouthatNYT @TheFix a poll today shows Trump at 64% in NY.
p2198
aV@SaysMissy who's your candidate?  Or are you sitting on the fence still?
p2199
aV@stuartpstevens legitimately curious on this one.  What happened?
p2200
aV@YourMindAches @JessicaJones I did
p2201
aV@JessicaJones where?
p2202
aV@stuartpstevens Stu, am I wrong or did you predict trump wouldn't win a primary?  (Im not a trump supporter btw)
p2203
aV@SaysMissy @ArmenianNewhye trump has gotten many fewer votes than Hillary.  You're just totally wrong here.
p2204
aV@SaysMissy @ArmenianNewhye Melissa -- genuinely curious -- do you think Trump would be good?  And WHY???
p2205
aV@KatieQLowes @jscandalp yeah but is anyone actually interested in that boring storyline??
p2206
aV@JonahNRO totally silly logic too.  Discounts the level of dislike of the candidate from the majority of the party
p2207
aV@BellamyYoung Q:  favorite movie of all time?
p2208
aV@AriFleischer @DavidChalian authentic and inauthentic??
p2209
aV@Nate_Cohn @Carrasquillo already is game over for him.  Staying in is really hurting Hill
p2210
aV@seanhannity @JonahNRO lol this fight is hilarious.  Keep it going guys PLEASE...
p2211
aV@SaysMissy @ArmenianNewhye LOL yup.  Trump will definitely accept VP!  What a dumb concept
p2212
aV@LukeBrinker @AnnCoulter this is dumb
p2213
aV@BellamyYoung missed Scandal tonight.  What happened???
p2214
aV@jonfortt yes...never assume that logic exists among GOP senators
p2215
aV@charlescwcooke I get it.  Though I disagree, I prefer your rationale to the GOP's "anyone who Obama doesn't pick"
p2216
aV@charlescwcooke so would you rather have a Trump/Hillary nominee in a year than an obviously qualified justice now?
p2217
aV@CNNAshleigh I think Vice sent a bunch of journalists there within the past year...
p2218
aV@BillKristol @Redistrict you won't launch anything.  You'll endorse Trump eventually.  Guarantee it!!
p2219
aV@davidaxelrod @SenSanders blah.  Bernie is boring at this point.  But...Hill-Bernie???
p2220
aV@BillKristol bill what are you even thinking?  trump is obviously the nominee.
p2221
aV@JonahNRO @NAAPC @seanhannity Jonah:  as soon as Trump starts talking lower taxes, you'll support him.  Trust me!
p2222
aVGavin Newsom would be a fantastic VP choice for Hillary.  Thoughts?
p2223
aV@ForecasterEnten @charlescwcooke he won't have much of a shot in NY against Trump
p2224
aV@tomgreenlive a lot of celebs seem to be speaking out against him, no?  Lots of endorsers too though I guess
p2225
aV@stuartpstevens @michaeldhar wow.  Obama beat Hillary in popular vote.
p2226
aV@KennySantucci @CarocciaOnTheGo check out some of axl's recent performances.  You may think twice
p2227
aV@heytana are all his offices like this?
p2228
aV@kellybensimon @IAmCait @JennyBoylan is it true cait is a Cruz supporter?
p2229
aV@LukeRussert @Nate_Cohn this doesn't make much sense considering Trump's massive appeal among the elderly.
p2230
aV@CharlesMBlow @neiltyson @realDonaldTrump I'm with Charles.  Baffling statement by the esteemed professor.  (Who I normally love)
p2231
aV@hblodget @day54 @jbarro really don't think it works like this.  Massive damage can't just be un-done for the general
p2232
aV@clmazin @BKFishmaster @PoppyHarlowCNN well are you sure he didn't stage the protests Craig?
p2233
aV@KenGardner11 @tonydokoupil meaning the Africa comment
p2234
aV@KMCRadio did Kasich get a single vote?
p2235
aV@Sam_MAFS @Chela_Consuela you and David?
p2236
aV@amandacarpenter @AnnCoulter don't you go on the same network that always puts her on?
p2237
aV@CGasparino @FoxBusiness weird
p2238
aV@jack_welch oh come on Jack.  Trump incites violence at his rallies
p2239
aV@hblodget @day54 @jbarro so you think large #s of people simply forgive and forget the hateful remarks?
p2240
aV@tmorello RATM should play at one of his rallies!  Would be epic
p2241
aV@JohnJHarwood @adamsmithtimes isn't it too late logistically for that to happen?
p2242
aV@tmorello hilarious
p2243
aV@stuartpstevens @IBDeditorials so Stu are you an isolationist?  Rand Paul?
p2244
aV@pinkbunny70 totally agree!  These debates have been borderline pathetic
p2245
aV@TheoloGOP lol!  Totally confused, you're right.
p2246
aV@pinkbunny70 totally agree that John King and CNN are a big part of the problem!!  Thanks for recognizing
p2247
aV@TheoloGOP ahh ok.  So everyone uses their current name except those who have tweeted that others are ashamed.  Got it!
p2248
aV@stuartpstevens wouldn't call that a crisis Stu
p2249
aV@jasian12345 would you have been a Perot supporter?
p2250
aV@TheoloGOP cool.  So should we all use our non-American names?
p2251
aV@taradublinrocks @pinkbunny70 @olsen_lynn they are not rational, I agree.  Important to defuse peacefully though.
p2252
aV@taradublinrocks @pinkbunny70 @olsen_lynn wow.  Just....wow.
p2253
aV@TheoloGOP noooo but I'm asking YOU!!
p2254
aV@TheoloGOP so I guess we now refer to all Americans by their European ancestors' names?  Or just him??
p2255
aV@taradublinrocks @olsen_lynn yikes
p2256
aV@RadioFreeTom @laura_lrnzo @stuartpstevens he's interesting.  Explains why he gets 2x coverage as Hillary
p2257
aV@stuartpstevens @RichHoffmann83 try 100x!  At least!
p2258
aV@TheoloGOP @olsen_lynn @sarahsside "real" name?  How so?
p2259
aV@taradublinrocks @olsen_lynn wow sounds extreme Tara...
p2260
aV@stuartpstevens @TheRichardSands and trump appeals to northerners...
p2261
aV@TheoloGOP @olsen_lynn @sarahsside why do you call him Drumpf?
p2262
aV@jasian12345 what about Trump's ties that are made in Mexico?
p2263
aV@jasian12345 he's bush??
p2264
aV@newtgingrich so his hurtful remarks re minorities have nothing to do with it?
p2265
aV@JonahNRO @TimAlberta he'll win the rust belt and thus the election.  The protectionism stuff goes a long way there
p2266
aV@RyanPoterack @JonahNRO @upperwestbruin I agree but we need the info to determine his IRR
p2267
aV@upperwestbruin @JonahNRO @RyanPoterack because we need to know  $ any he started with and what he has now to see his IRR.  We have neither
p2268
aV@JonahNRO @upperwestbruin @RyanPoterack it's all unclear bc we don't know for a fact how much $ he inherited.  Maybe he can open the books?
p2269
aV@DouthatNYT @Taniel so what was the point of the election??
p2270
aV@ochocinco seriously?  The credential of one of the best WRs ever doesn't work???
p2271
aV@MsRebeccaBlack why?
p2272
aV@BoneNumber207 @davidaxelrod @politicoroger easier than you think.  Sweep the rust belt.  May well have minority popular vote and win
p2273
aV@DouthatNYT ehh...He will clean up in FL, CA, NY/NJ/CT and will get a majority in delegates
p2274
aV@davidaxelrod @politicoroger trump will be at 50% support in that party within 2 weeks
p2275
aV@benshapiro nah, no one cares abt anyone's father's occupation
p2276
aV@amyjccuddy they just cling to the 5% of "scientists" who agree, I guess.  And maybe convince themselves they're right?
p2277
aV@charlescwcooke lots of those old people in Queens will be voting for Trump in the general
p2278
aV@amyjccuddy they are just totally clueless on this
p2279
aV@ReformedBroker "rightfully" is debatable
p2280
aV@JeffreyGoldberg weird joke by Cruz
p2281
aV@ReformedBroker great point
p2282
aV@MonicaCrowley  yes!  And they didn't even turn the cameras :(
p2283
aV@benshapiro Ben, trump is gonna be the nominee.  May as well get used to it (?)
p2284
aV@chrislhayes @ninatypewriter @michaelbd  such as?
p2285
aV@DouthatNYT (maybe not in 30 mins but that's gonna be the ticket)
p2286
aV@DouthatNYT this is definitely happening
p2287
aV@hardball_chris but why?  No mileage in more trump attacks??
p2288
aV@mtaibbi @FrankLuntz @JohnKasich come on Matt.  Don't you know that a family would be bankrupt if it owed $19 trillion???
p2289
aV@LizzieGrubman there are too many!!
p2290
aV@sjauhar @nytopinion then I guess Bernie and Hillary are guilty of the same thing?
p2291
aV@charlescwcooke why not?  Can you read his mind?
p2292
aV@katiecouric gee I wonder why??
p2293
aV@TheLazyNative @jeremyscahill so no fault of Saddam, all Hillary's fault?
p2294
aV@TheLazyNative @jeremyscahill i was referring to the sanctions, and wondering how Jeremy would apportion blame between Hillary and Saddam.
p2295
aV@TheLazyNative @jeremyscahill again, Hillary's fault or Saddam's?
p2296
aV@jeremyscahill so was that her fault or Hussein's?
p2297
aV@MarlaMHughes @charlescwcooke what are risk corridors?
p2298
aV@charlescwcooke @MarlaMHughes has Rubio actually accomplished anything in his 6 yrs in the senate?
p2299
aV@benshapiro @PhilHickey6 the GOP is coalescing around Trump.  Endorsements should start piling up this week.
p2300
aV@hblodget @PamEngel12 wow very presidential.  I don't think he mentioned a single war crime this time.
p2301
aV@benshapiro haha if only "wins" mattered.  It's delegates.
p2302
aV@ReformedBroker not a trump guy by any stretch, but natl approval polls are meaningless
p2303
aV@stuartpstevens @DoghouseDano this is crazy.  Trump will easily clinch.  Easy majorities in NY/NJ/CA/PA...game over
p2304
aV@AriFleischer no one cares.
p2305
aV@stuartpstevens @GOPBlackChick obviously the entire GOP will come around to supporting him.  Really sad.
p2306
aV@DouthatNYT no Art Laffer???
p2307
aV@stuartpstevens @bhweingarten all a moot point.  Trump is obviously going to clinch this.  Just wait till NY/NJ/CA primaries
p2308
aV@amandacarpenter why are white working class men mutually exclusive with either of the 2 groups you mention?
p2309
aV@AriMelber @CrainsNewYork @InTheMkts where is the documentation behind your assertion re trump income &lt;500k?
p2310
aV@BenSasse @repjohnlewis thanks to Rep Lewis and to Sen Sasse for such great leadership!
p2311
aV@Austan_Goolsbee wouldn't that ensure a 3rd party moderate running?
p2312
aV@matthewjdowd nomination isn't determined by "state primaries won".  Name of the game is getting delegates.
p2313
aV@MMFlint and a whopping 3 delegates!  Lol
p2314
aV@DouthatNYT why are both Cruz and Trump calling for Rubio to drop out?  Who's right?
p2315
aV@MsRebeccaBlack what song?
p2316
aV@AbbyMartin can't believe you're wasting time watching him!
p2317
aV@davidaxelrod you mean the highest paid 'practicing' lawyer in the U.S.?  Would be a very Trumpian choice.
p2318
aV@clmazin I wonder who Trump's freshman year college roommate was?  Genuinely curious and would also love to hear from that guy.
p2319
aV@R_Thaler I think the Cruz upward momentum is striking.  He could make a run at FL.
p2320
aV@charlescwcooke there's been an overattention to 'wins'.  10 out of 15 thus far means less than 34% of GOP vote total
p2321
aV@charlescwcooke if total votes cast for Trump fall below 34% after tonight
p2322
aV@hblodget this article says trump has 36% of the vote; it's actually 34%
p2323
aV@stuartpstevens @realDonaldTrump @ApscoHenry so if Romney is a loser, does that mean Obama is a winner?
p2324
aV@BillKristol especially if that candidate could win a few states and deprive Hill and Trump of 270 electorals...send it to the House
p2325
aV@AriFleischer why is no one asking Trump about his company?  Does it make $?  Has it ever?  Any proof?
p2326
aV@AriFleischer people like having jobs
p2327
aV@AriFleischer not a Trump fan, but doubtful Ari
p2328
aV@AnnCoulter when?
p2329
aV@AnnCoulter when did he say that?
p2330
aV@Nate_Cohn @tackettdc pretty sure most frauds have a really high approval rating until they're exposed
p2331
aV@davidaxelrod @stuartpstevens 10/15 # is misleading, considering he has received just 34% of all GOP votes cast.  Obj is delegates not wins
p2332
aV@IngrahamAngle the guy who created a successful business is attacking the guy whose business went bankrupt repeatedly
p2333
aV@milojbloom @morningmoneyben thanks very interesting
p2334
aV@milojbloom @morningmoneyben any idea which states?  And do they also apply if you've won the primary?
p2335
aV@morningmoneyben I just can't picture this guy willing to roll into Cleveland with just 35%-40% support
p2336
aV@morningmoneyben true but brokered convention could be clear in a month or so and he'd still have time to make the jump I think
p2337
aV@morningmoneyben the potential for him being embarrassed at the convention may be too much for him to bear
p2338
aV@morningmoneyben I'm doubting Trump takes part in a convention where he may lose.  If it's close enough I bet he jumps to 3rd party run
p2339
aV@armandodkos @morningmoneyben agree.  After all this he has only received 34% of the GOP votes.  Far from an overwhelming frontrunner
p2340
aV@Nate_Cohn Quietly a "bad" night for Trump, no?  &lt;30% in OK?  Reddest state.  Really?
p2341
aV@davidfrum This is a bad night for Trump.  &lt;30% in OK (reddest state in US) is a SERIOUS problem
p2342
aV@stephenfhayes he said zero chance today
p2343
aV@Carpophores @megynkelly @DLoesch me neither.  so why take the chance?  Realize the others are uncertain too but this seems way beyond that
p2344
aV@Carpophores @megynkelly @DLoesch Actually I think he is.  Have heard multiple stories of business partners suing, being furious, etc
p2345
aV@Carpophores @megynkelly @DLoesch agree there but actually obama has been distancing us from SA.  Still work to do though.
p2346
aV@Carpophores @megynkelly @DLoesch yeah that spat w pope was terrible
p2347
aV@Carpophores @megynkelly @DLoesch exactly.  And he takes huge offense at the slightest insult.  Going to happen a lot w other countries.
p2348
aV@Carpophores @megynkelly @DLoesch true but runs the military and foreign policy
p2349
aV@Carpophores @megynkelly @DLoesch i like kasich a lot.  We agree on that!
p2350
aV@Carpophores @megynkelly @DLoesch i hear you man.  Me too.  Just so worried abt giving someone the keys to the military w/no experience
p2351
aV@Carpophores @megynkelly @DLoesch haven't heard that.  I'll check it out.
p2352
aV@Carpophores @megynkelly @DLoesch fair point that they may be aggressors too.  Just worry abt Trump's remarks + total lack of track record
p2353
aV@Carpophores @megynkelly @DLoesch why assume that?  Again, I don't read minds.
p2354
aV@Carpophores @megynkelly @DLoesch This country has never elected someone with 0 government experience.  But this is the year to try?  Why?
p2355
aV@Carpophores @megynkelly @DLoesch Also when was America great exactly and why?
p2356
aV@Carpophores @megynkelly @DLoesch so you're cool with a couple new wars, just to "grab" for America?
p2357
aV@Carpophores @megynkelly @DLoesch i need better evidence than what comes out of his mouth?
p2358
aV@Carpophores @megynkelly @DLoesch Appreciate that you're not convinced just yet!  I don't know man, some scary stuff coming out of his mouth
p2359
aV@Carpophores @megynkelly @DLoesch guy has not spent a day in public service so i have no actions to go on.
p2360
aV@Carpophores @megynkelly @DLoesch haha the logic of Trump supporters is amazing.
p2361
aV@Carpophores @megynkelly @DLoesch except when it comes to "taking the oil", "getting rid of Isis in 5 minutes," and "grabbing for America".
p2362
aV@Carpophores @megynkelly @DLoesch Ahh, ok.  So he doesn't mean what he says.  You're a better mind-reader than me I guess!
p2363
aV@Carpophores @megynkelly @DLoesch Iraq and Syria
p2364
aV@Carpophores @megynkelly @DLoesch he has advocated torture and invading multiple countries
p2365
aV@megynkelly @DLoesch Did Reagan advocate multiple war crimes during his campaign?  I don't think so.
p2366
aV@stuartpstevens @JasonHornbuckle @NolteNC there is one party boss right now.  (Hint: He is also in the WWE Hall of Fame).
p2367
aV@jbarro Trmp is incredibly dangerous.  He is openly advocating war crimes.  R we convinced he wont try to take over the world?  Serious Q.
p2368
aV@jbarro right.  Because it's Hillary they can't do it.  I almost wonder if the Dems would be better off with some no-name moderate running
p2369
aV@ashleyiaco @Cosmopolitan you didn't like that?!
p2370
aV@davidplouffe @magicsilicon and I'll add as a NY/NJ guy he seems to be very well respected in both.  Sounds crazy but the golf stuff helps
p2371
aV@davidplouffe @magicsilicon David, any chance Trump wins NY or NJ?  Seems like that could single handedly determine this race v Hillary
p2372
aV@newtgingrich oh come on Newt.  Why didn't he do it on meet the press?  His earpiece wasn't working?  That's moronic.
p2373
aV@charlescwcooke serious question -- who will you vote for?  A) Hillary; B) No one; C) Trump; D) Write-in
p2374
aV@BenSasse Courageous move today Senator Sasse.  Thank you for your valuable leadership!!
p2375
aV@ReformedBroker 1) Rocket Queen; 2) My Michelle; 3) Paradise
p2376
aV@stuartpstevens It is well worth 20 mins!  Hilarious takedown.
p2377
aV@RomanP11 @mattyglesias We have no idea what he supports re health care.  Wants to scrap Obamacare and has no alternative idea.
p2378
aV@mattyglesias trump is also for a far right, extremely aggressive US foreign policy.  ("Take the oil, grab for US, reinstate torture, etc)
p2379
aV@mattyglesias huh?  Trump is running on some of the most far right ideas we've ever seen out of a major candidate
p2380
aV@JoeNBC gee, you think?
p2381
aV@warriors_zen @stuartpstevens when was it great exactly?  What year(s)?
p2382
aV@mattyglesias hopefully Fulop
p2383
aV@murphymike @stuartpstevens agree and they should strategically roll out comparable statements from other GOP leaders
p2384
aV@stuartpstevens @maggieNYT not defending Trump, but grad degree does not a genius make.
p2385
aV@SteffensBradley @JonahNRO Bradley what are his great policies?
p2386
aV@JonahNRO @rev_b_wayne maybe (hopefully) his ceiling will hold firm at 50% of GOP?
p2387
aV@stuartpstevens @MedianPolitics @CNNMoney except Edwards is 1000x more reasonable?
p2388
aV@JonahNRO @MikeMcDonald901 it's so stupid.  What candidate has ever been disqualified due to tax returns?  Have voters ever cared??  Nope
p2389
aV@davidaxelrod does anyone care?  Have they ever, about any candidates returns??
p2390
aV@stuartpstevens @realDonaldTrump and how many candidates were in that 2012 primary?
p2391
aV@zbyronwolf @JohnJHarwood yikes
p2392
aV@stuartpstevens LoL...didn't they try that once already with Jeb?
p2393
aV@stuartpstevens @AaronDFordNV do you still think Trump won't win a primary or caucus?  Just curious.  I know you thought that at one point..
p2394
aV@justinamash @magicsilicon curious who you think the 3rd party candidate would be?
p2395
aV@stuartpstevens not sure if not inventing something is tantamount to "trying to stop FBI"
p2396
aV@MariaBartiromo @applenws @FoxBusiness why Russia?  Paltry sales there
p2397
aV@HillaryClinton @SabrinaSiddiqui guess you agree with Trump on this one?
p2398
aV@drumgal95 @SJCdrums @TRXCymbals @Drumtacs @Headhuntersstix @TlntdMusicians @Regular_Hero where can we hear this whole cover?  It's awesome!
p2399
aV@drumgal95 FYI -- love the "Savior" cover!!  Trying to learn it myself now...
p2400
aV@RichLowry @jpodhoretz tantamount to saying someone "lied" which has happened in every prez election for the last century
p2401
aV@Bethenny @kanyewest kale the salad?
p2402
aV@jack_welch @tedcruz Jack, are you a Cruz supporter now?
p2403
aV@billmaher you think the Dems would handle this differently if roles reversed?  Zero chance Bill!!
p2404
aV@amayasays what did she say?  Missed it sadly!
p2405
aV@IngrahamAngle How is cuomo's pronunciation incorrect?
p2406
aV@IngrahamAngle what did they screw up?
p2407
aV@jonfavs Wrong -- no one has said he doesn't have the right to name a nominee
p2408
aV@RichLowry @NRO sounds like some pretty bad advice.  Trump will always have a comeback tailored exactly for what hurts/embarrasses the most
p2409
aV@Jesselansner @mattyglesias a few thousand do
p2410
aV@mattyglesias @DeanBaker13 I do...
p2411
aV@johnpodesta so they are hurting in spite of Obama's efforts, or because of them?
p2412
aV@johnpodesta so to be clear, does she think Obama has done a good job with the economy?
p2413
aV@jheil Bernie won this debate, hands down
p2414
aV@MonicaCrowley isn't that how it's pronounced?
p2415
aV@benshapiro what, you don't like the mustard Mumu?
p2416
aV@BeschlossDC cool!  Where is this?
p2417
aV@GeraldoRivera @olsen_lynn I encourage you to check and see what the BLS defines as a "job".  The definition is hugely broad.
p2418
aV@GeraldoRivera @olsen_lynn oh come on Geraldo!  Have you looked at the market lately??
p2419
aV@arlogilbert come on dude.  No one would agree with that!!
p2420
aV@magicsilicon not sure they're deciding who will "move on".  Are you?
p2421
aV@MMFlint hey man!  So do you agree the banks are all fraudulent?
p2422
aV@FareedZakaria are we not currently an energy superpower?  10m barrels a day...
p2423
aV@elerianm incredible.
p2424
aV@jonathanchait @JohnJHarwood who's  right?
p2425
aV@AliABCNews @JohnJHarwood so did he vote on it?
p2426
aV@quintywinties @vcav huh?
p2427
aV@benshapiro @pattonoswalt why are you so against abortion?
p2428
aV@JamesFallows @KatrinaNation is he even competent to be a senator?
p2429
aV@JamesFallows @KatrinaNation just terrible
p2430
aV@JoeNBC and he may well beat Hill
p2431
aV@JoeNBC it's going to be Cruz eventually
p2432
aV@JoeNBC come on Joe, you know trump won't do this
p2433
aV@KenGardner11 Rubio is terrible
p2434
aV@jodiapplekay @RealMichaelKay what would he count as a 10?
p2435
aV@carlywaddell what do you like and what don't you??
p2436
aV@stuartpstevens @chrisferraioli how do you focus on making one cheaper?  More govt subsidies for solar/wind?
p2437
aV@JustinPulitzer @JeffCoxCNBCcom for how long do you suggest keeping rates at these levels?
p2438
aV@Scott_Phillips @MylesKennedy this is awesome!  Good luck with the album, can't wait to listen!
p2439
aVRT @TLImusic: To @realDonaldTrump: "You've gotten far w/ all your money, but you'll never win cuz u ain't no Bernie." @SenSanders https://t\u2026
p2440
aV@davidaxelrod @HillaryClinton lol really?
p2441
aV@CharlesMBlow @2TwelveHundreds who would you prefer, Charles?
p2442
aV@MMFlint come on Michael.  Why do you want a socialist?
p2443
aV@AnnCoulter ann what happened to Trump??
p2444
aV@benshapiro hey Ben who's your candidate?
p2445
aV@BillKristol no one cares
p2446
aV@MMFlint why is a socialist appealing to you?  What about the socialist disasters of the 20th century?
p2447
aV@MMFlint why do you want a socialist to win?
p2448
aV@PrisonPlanet @Tate what is that??
p2449
aV@jimcramer @jhan_hi or maybe a lost 2 decades for the stock market?  S&amp;P lower in real $ today than in 2000.
p2450
aV@BillKristol what's the harm in holding a rally?  Especially if the vets themselves want to attend?
p2451
aV@danpfeiffer no way.  He's out and will convince the other networks to show his event.  Brilliant (?)
p2452
aV@stuartpstevens haha Tom Steyer too
p2453
aV@ChrisCuomo @allchops1 the recovery has been the slowest in history
p2454
aV@jimcramer so at what hr today will the market go negative?  Here we go again...
p2455
aV@jheil @KBAndersen why is she still the favorite?  She has a track record of losing and now Sanders' $ situation is improving dramatically
p2456
aVIt was great to comment on the markets today for @CBSNewYork!:\u000a\u000ahttps://t.co/lxLue6aUpp
p2457
aV@AriFleischer trump and Cruz will take this to the convention.  And good luck getting either to release their delegates...
p2458
aV@AriFleischer yikes
p2459
aV@mtaibbi it is hilarious.  Immigration huge issue for those Iowans too
p2460
aV@JohnJHarwood why does he look so nervous??
p2461
aV@benshapiro who is taking issue with the loan itself?  I thought the issue was his failure to report.
p2462
aV@pewresearch hiring any attorneys??
p2463
aV@jbarro how bout a Nike Fuel Band??
p2464
aV@greg_ip @JedKolko availability bias?
p2465
aV@charlesornstein @olsen_lynn @kyletblaine has he responded to this?
p2466
aV@mattyglesias availability bias too
p2467
aV@tmorello I don't know, you've been in at least one that comes pretty close!
p2468
aV@stuartpstevens who would you prefer:  Hill or Trump?
p2469
aV@fmanjoo what was the 'system'?
p2470
aV@stuartpstevens @SpyTalker stocks aren't up.  Virtually the same as they were in 2000 in real $
p2471
aV@ReformedBroker @pmarca as are "contribute", "abilities" and "society"
p2472
aV@CarlyFiorina horrible
p2473
aV@nntaleb @sapinker but isn't his analysis based on casualties as % of population, rather than overall # of casualties?
p2474
aV@JoshZumbrun @andrewvandam @pmarca thanks Josh.  Good data for the elusive "what's fair" answer
p2475
aV@AbbyMartin @TheSoup maybe the Kardashian show?
p2476
aV@andrewvandam @pmarca @JoshZumbrun wonder what % of national wealth those 400 are?  I'm guessing over 1.96%?
p2477
aV@mattyglesias in order to get the GOP nom?  Not odd at all
p2478
aV@neelkashkari anything by @sapinker!
p2479
aV@jbarro @philipaklein @TPCarney would love to know what metrics you're going by re "talent".  His record low approval in NJ?
p2480
aV@greta the goal was to decrease uninsured.  That + insurance cos making $ doesn't necessarily indicate failure
p2481
aV@greta both are true.  Point being?
p2482
aV@SamHarrisOrg @thegeopolitico @FareedZakaria where can we learn more about how the poll was run and who ran it?  Is it flawed somehow?
p2483
aV@stuartpstevens @ChasFlemming how much does likability matter?  Was Nixon likable?
p2484
aV@Austan_Goolsbee @hblodget @BrettLoGiurato have you?  Would love details!  (They don't really seem to exist in NYC).
p2485
aV@RichardDawkins what religion?
p2486
aV@KateBennett_DC @stuartpstevens what is your point?  No more golf for him?  Or I guess he should time it strategically?
p2487
aV@cabaum1 @greta know of any for-profit news organizations who would turn down an interview w Trump?  I don't!
p2488
aV@cabaum1 @greta trump = ratings
p2489
aVAhh, the joys of cheap gas: https://t.co/B5JXIYCjRM
p2490
aV@6ae025af2132401 @MarkHalperin @realDonaldTrump check the Iowa polls
p2491
aV@6ae025af2132401 @MarkHalperin need voters to actually vote and with zero ground game it's gonna be tough
p2492
aV@MarkHalperin no need to blame the voters...just point out that Trump supporters won't turn out.  Esp in caucus states where its complicated
p2493
aV@6ae025af2132401 @MarkHalperin not wishful when there are decades of history backing me up!
p2494
aV@MarkHalperin his backers are mostly uneducated and will not be voting in large #'s
p2495
aV@MarkHalperin he has basically no chance of winning Iowa and then Cruz will have all the momentum
p2496
aV@MarkHalperin but can Trump get the actual votes with zero ground game?  I'm highly skeptical.
p2497
aV@stuartpstevens @Swdinosaurs @mlewyn 400m
p2498
aV@Wicknicky @SenSanders he shouldn't worry about that.  If dems can't win bc of an independent run its on them to find a better candidate!
p2499
aV@SenSanders yes, which is why you should run as an Independent!  Millions would love to see it!!
p2500
aV@stuartpstevens @BernieSanders wonder if he may run as an independent?
p2501
aV@Jared_Falk @drumeo Cool, I'll check it out.  Thanks and keep up the great vids!
p2502
aV@Jared_Falk @drumeo I didn't know there was a membership option.   (learned about you guys on youtube).  Where can I learn more?  Thanks!
p2503
aV@Jared_Falk @drumeo awesome.  Thanks Jared!
p2504
aV@Jared_Falk @drumeo Hi Jared -- where exactly can I find this lesson?  Do I need to be a subscriber?
p2505
aV@binarybits @mattyglesias wrong info re Sweden: https://t.co/39JaVSGoBt
p2506
aV@MMFlint where in NYC is this?
p2507
aV@greta you can give millions to a hospital and still be greedy (say you have $10b and give $2m?)
p2508
aV@heilDonaldTrump @mattyglesias totally absurd and biased to have a friend and former employee complimenting her mid-debate
p2509
aV@mattyglesias also why is stephonopolous praising Hillary mid-debate?  Abc hugely pro-Hill
p2510
aV@GOP haha!  And your party leader (Trump) makes prob about 10x what Hill does in that time frame
p2511
aV@ReformedBroker @amazon @rjc722du is it good so far?
p2512
aV@BruceNV @stuartpstevens @KenGardner11 https://t.co/sYgFl0zR75
p2513
aV@larry_kudlow @clarionproject interesting.  Also interesting to keep in mind polls showing US muslims' moderation:  https://t.co/Xe8J4EJh4b
p2514
aV@larry_kudlow @clarionproject even if all true what should be done about it?
p2515
aV@ShawnDrurySC @stuartpstevens @KenGardner11 it's true.  Some bush ego thing I guess at this point.  He's totally ineffective
p2516
aV@ShawnDrurySC @stuartpstevens @KenGardner11 I almost think Jeb is hurting the party now.  Maybe drop out, party consolidates on Rubio
p2517
aV@SaysMissy so are you a Trump supporter?
p2518
aV@ShawnDrurySC @stuartpstevens @KenGardner11 starting to wonder if Christie or Kasich comes out of this scrum.  Everyone else majorly flawed
p2519
aV@ShawnDrurySC @stuartpstevens @KenGardner11 Jeb?!  Let's not get crazy here...
p2520
aV@stuartpstevens @KenGardner11 good point, plus turnout of non-college educated (trumps base) never good
p2521
aV@stuartpstevens @KenGardner11 agree Trump loses IA but adding Cruz to pantheon of past winners Santorum and Huck only means so much...
p2522
aV@stuartpstevens @KenGardner11 seems to be steamrolling SC and other southern polls...maybe that fades if he loses IA/NH I guess
p2523
aV@stuartpstevens @KenGardner11 what's your theory on Trump sinking?  He's been steady 25-40% almost all race
p2524
aV@sapinker reasonable?
p2525
aV@McFaul @realDonaldTrump true within his own country at least?
p2526
aV@jheil come on John you can't think Trump is still the frontrunner right?
p2527
aV@stuartpstevens @MRAbearsfan so Rubio was the cool guy?  Yikes
p2528
aV@BobPisani @JohnMayer @chrisbotti nice!!
p2529
aV@AlexisinNH @BernieSanders lol so I guess # of supporters is irrelevant?
p2530
aV@AlexisinNH @BernieSanders what's wrong with Bernie talking?  He has many more supporters than Trump.
p2531
aV@larry_kudlow @GovChristie @batchelorshow @StephenMoore please list accomplishments here!  -- former NJ resident
p2532
aV@larry_kudlow @GovChristie @batchelorshow @StephenMoore why do you admire him exactly?
p2533
aV@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump hey man is your dad running as a 3rd party or what??  So hard to beat Cruz!!
p2534
aV@ninatypewriter @nytimes meh that was sort of stupid actually
p2535
aV@charlescwcooke it's clearly gonna be Cruz
p2536
aV@BillKristol @RameshPonnuru bill- who's your candidate?
p2537
aV@CallyGingrich @newtgingrich come on calista.  Really?
p2538
aV@DorindaMedley  p.s.  Who's your candidate??
p2539
aV@chucktodd @nathanlgonzales if only any voters knew who alinsky was!
p2540
aV@debluc745 @DorindaMedley @RandPaul nope.  Still being investigated
p2541
aV@ChrisCuomo @realDonaldTrump trump is starting to seem desperate.  Maybe resigned to Cruz steamrolling these caucus states?
p2542
aV@DorindaMedley @RandPaul hah probably true.  Best not to engage!  (Although GW bridge traffic is indeed infuriating)
p2543
aV@DorindaMedley @RandPaul Christie just had no rebuttal?!
p2544
aV@TrumpNation16 @benshapiro so beating piers is the benchmark? Haha
p2545
aV@AriFleischer how was that a home run?
p2546
aV@NolteNC @MichaelCohen212 which policy?
p2547
aV@charlescwcooke which part can't you follow?
p2548
aV@TrumpNation16 @benshapiro haven't noticed it yet but guess I'll stay tuned!
p2549
aV@TrumpNation16 @benshapiro Ben is a great debater?
p2550
aV@PrisonPlanet I thought Alex jones was a Trump guy?
p2551
aV@TrumpNation16 @benshapiro which ones?  Every single one?
p2552
aV@TrumpNation16 @benshapiro why?
p2553
aV@benshapiro Ben are you a Cruz guy?
p2554
aV@ReformedBroker lol...yeah we're good
p2555
aV@LizzieGrubman who's your candidate?
p2556
aV@AnnCoulter I agree ann.  But supposedly he is totally disorganized in the caucus states.  Why?
p2557
aV@ellencarmichael @charlescwcooke who won in your expert opinion?
p2558
aV@stuartpstevens man, you really don't like Trump!
p2559
aV@ninatypewriter wonder why they're focused on this now instead of yrs ago when gun violence was much greater, esp in NY
p2560
aV@ScottStapp @mrsjstapp nice!  What are you guys doing in Johannesburg?
p2561
aV@JohnJHarwood @danpfeiffer Superbowl decided in overtime
p2562
aV@NateSilver538 can't you have both?
p2563
aV@Austan_Goolsbee @ac452 @WNTonight but in Christianity is that penalty actually carried out?
p2564
aV@lieberg_heather impressive!!
p2565
aV@lieberg_heather how many miles?
p2566
aV@AlexisinNH Trump's
p2567
aV@stuartpstevens @endmoronism @TPCarney what's his talent again?
p2568
aV@AlexisinNH his position on this is ridiculous
p2569
aV@CarlyFiorina pretty sure conservatives would pick Trump judging from the polls
p2570
aV@Nate_Cohn @DLeonhardt totally.  Alex Jones loves him and agreed with his comments.  (And Jones also has more viewers than CNN)
p2571
aV@cenkuygur congrats Cenk!
p2572
aV@secupp and who's your candidate S.E.?
p2573
aV@stuartpstevens @MEPFuller where is the poll that indicates he's 4th?
p2574
aV@AriFleischer what are your thoughts on this Ari?
p2575
aV@charlescwcooke @KatrinaNation @thenation she's right
p2576
aV@charlescwcooke @CateMartel @realDonaldTrump who's your candidate Charles?
p2577
aV@GarrettHaake how is it dangerous?
p2578
aV@megynkelly who are the terrorists that are not radical?
p2579
aV@MarkHalperin @IvankaTrump why would that be interesting?
p2580
aV@cabaum1 @greta great question Caroline!
p2581
aV@SamHarrisOrg hi Sam -- wondering what your thoughts are on Trumps latest statement regarding ceasing Muslim immigration?  Thanks!
p2582
aV@adamsteinbaugh @charlescwcooke @EsotericCD so would you advocate a completely unrestricted 2nd Amendment?
p2583
aV@BobBurg @EsotericCD @charlescwcooke agree, I was just refuting your initial point about behavior specifically mentioned in const
p2584
aV@BobBurg @bljacka @EsotericCD @charlescwcooke didn't know the const says anything about the right to buy a newspaper but thanks for the info
p2585
aV@bljacka @BobBurg @EsotericCD @charlescwcooke there's a constitutional right to buy a newspaper?
p2586
aV@bigdaddyhags @EsotericCD @charlescwcooke that mentions buying guns?
p2587
aV@colly_wolly @charlescwcooke @EsotericCD how so?
p2588
aV@BobBurg @EsotericCD @charlescwcooke does the const specifically say we can't drive 100 mph?
p2589
aV@njh2005 @charlescwcooke @EsotericCD how so?
p2590
aV@BobBurg @EsotericCD @charlescwcooke interesting interpretation but not correct
p2591
aV@charlescwcooke @EsotericCD am I wrong?
p2592
aV@tilmanheyer @EsotericCD there's a fundamental right to buy a gun?
p2593
aV@EsotericCD @charlescwcooke 2nd am says nothing abt right to buy a gun
p2594
aV@jbouie @pmarca @HimayCo and there's a constitutional right to fly?
p2595
aV@pmarca @RichardBarber26 Marc where does the constitution say there's a right to buy a gun?
p2596
aV@JohnJHarwood @charlescwcooke they're saying no constitutional right to fly
p2597
aV@kimiwillingham when did she say this?
p2598
aV@PoliSnark2Day @davidaxelrod what?  That doesn't make any sense
p2599
aV@PoliSnark2Day @davidaxelrod "arms" yes.  Not guns
p2600
aV@PoliSnark2Day @davidaxelrod neither is buying a gun
p2601
aV@PoliSnark2Day @davidaxelrod (which we already do)
p2602
aV@PoliSnark2Day @davidaxelrod how bout preventing them from flying on planes?
p2603
aV@PoliSnark2Day @davidaxelrod why?
p2604
aV@davidaxelrod has anyone said that's a bad idea?
p2605
aV@shushugah @pewresearch right, figured it out after your tweet.  Fascinating #s in there
p2606
aV@Atul_Gawande it would help if people acknowledge the 2nd amendment has become a net negative and should be changed/repealed
p2607
aV@shushugah @pewresearch thanks!
p2608
aV@pewresearch what does the "someone else" column mean?
p2609
aV@RandomWalk76 @Atul_Gawande the const applies to all Americans but when some of its provisions  are net negatives we should change them
p2610
aV@RandomWalk76 @Atul_Gawande no, unless you know of a correlation between terrorist healthcare and crime
p2611
aV@Atul_Gawande @NRA why is no one suggesting a massive gun buyback?  Is it taboo to suggest we need fewer/zero guns?  Why?
p2612
aV@kelly_clarkson @amyschumer or better yet why not just ban the vast majority of guns and offer buybacks for the ones already out there?
p2613
aV@AriFleischer and what good exactly would his remarks do, Ari?
p2614
aV@jbjakobsen @ReformedBroker disagree.  ISM non-manufacturing slowing down rapidly, and numerous corporate bankruptcies on the horizon
p2615
aV@frumpybob @benshapiro so do you think any person should face any restrictions at all on buying arms?
p2616
aV@CramersShirt @jonsteinberg @jimcramer what makes yahoo finance better than goog finance?
p2617
aV@benshapiro so are you saying because something can't be 100% prevented, it's not worth taking action to lessen the frequency?
p2618
aV@IngrahamAngle where are you getting this?
p2619
aV@arketex @benshapiro you got any source for this or what?
p2620
aV@davidfrum huh? what do you mean?
p2621
aV@AndyRichter @notabevigoda awesome tweet Andy!  Agree 100%.
p2622
aV@BrookingsInst what a joke.  An embarrassing statistic for Americans.
p2623
aV@ReformedBroker horrible
p2624
aV@NateSilver538 are your models factoring in the leverage Trump has over the GOP by threatening to run as independent?
p2625
aV@ReformedBroker seems like another giuliani (NE 'law and order' moderate), but with a worse governing record...I don't see him going far
p2626
aV@freedom4_aurora @cenkuygur @slk2286 It's moronic to ask a question?  (also, I don't know what hug correlation means)
p2627
aV@freedom4_aurora @cenkuygur @slk2286 My q refers to the way the religion is practiced/interpreted, not the textual substance
p2628
aV@cenkuygur @slk2286 just out of curiosity do you think Islam is compatible with western values?
p2629
aV@jasian12345 @mitchellvii @WavRidr101 what is this?
p2630
aV@mitchellvii so I have the burden of proof here?  Not the guy running for president based on wild accusations/false statements?
p2631
aV@mitchellvii @jasian12345 @WavRidr101 he made an incorrect assertion abt "thousands and thousands" of people.  Wouldn't call it quibbling.
p2632
aV@mitchellvii @jasian12345 @WavRidr101 so the Post article said thousands and thousands?
p2633
aV@jasian12345 @WavRidr101 @mitchellvii wrong.  Where did Trump see this?  In the news somewhere or did he personally go to jersey city?
p2634
aV@WavRidr101 @mitchellvii @jasian12345 trump said "thousands and thousands" which was a total fabrication.
p2635
aV@jasian12345 @mitchellvii so there were "thousands and thousands" in Jersey City?
p2636
aV@mitchellvii @jasian12345 "thousands and thousands" of them?  And I guess Trump has never met the reporter, right?
p2637
aV@mitchellvii @jasian12345 is he going to keep telling lies about 9/11 and the reporter he supposedly never met?
p2638
aV@RachelPlatten @joygivermike well your songs are awesome so well done!
p2639
aV@RachelPlatten @joygivermike with no input from the record label whatsoever?
p2640
aV@mtaibbi @davidalancrow nah he'll just start ripping Ted Cruz
p2641
aV@davidfrum @TheAtlantic @mollyesque come on Frum, do we really need another Trump story?  Pretty sure everyone gets it by now.
p2642
aV@sapinker @BillGates @BI_Strategy @drake_baer Steven -- I think I speak for a lot of us who would also love to see YOUR list of 17!
p2643
aV@MarketWatch wrong.  Chart says 62%.
p2644
aV@msttrader @TheStreet what does the red line represent?
p2645
aV@davidfrum @kdrum David -- I'm curious if you've read Ryan Crocker's WSJ op-ed today, and if so what did you think of his argument?
p2646
aV@billmckibben got anything here Bill?
p2647
aV@NaomiAKlein got anything here or is there simply no good counter-argument?
p2648
aV@sierraclub anything on this, or just totally speechless?
p2649
aV@GeoffreySupran @nytimes hey any answer to this or is there just no counter-arg?
p2650
aV@mattsorum agree Matt...horrific and shocking events
p2651
aV@superherohq thanks and keep up the great reporting Ryan
p2652
aV@superherohq unbelievable and shocking.  Hoping for the best for the rest of the band, the fans and everyone else in Paris
p2653
aV@Instacart why do you keep advertising Costco delivery in NYC even though you don't do it anymore?  Maybe you should stop claiming it?
p2654
aV@KarlRove @realDonaldTrump which facts are incorrect?
p2655
aV@HotlineJosh @RichLowry how so Josh?  He seemed very shaky and weak up there
p2656
aV@tomabrahams @RandPaul come on guy, seriously?
p2657
aV@PeterSinger @gavinoxman fascinating map.  The Israel v Iraq #s in particular.
p2658
aV@GeoffreySupran @nytimes any word on this, or no?
p2659
aV@trish_regan @realDonaldTrump @snl what didn't you like about it?
p2660
aV@TheJanelleShow so you're not voting for him?  Lol
p2661
aV@sierraclub any response to this, or no?
p2662
aV@billmckibben any word on this?
p2663
aV@BillKristol is it not reasonable to attack someone with multiple violent incidents in his past?
p2664
aV@billmckibben what about the argument that CO2 emissions will now increase due to truck and rail transport of that oil?
p2665
aV@NaomiAKlein what about the argument that CO2 emissions will now increase due to truck and rail transport of that oil?
p2666
aV@sierraclub what about the argument that CO2 emissions will now increase due to truck and rail transport of that oil?
p2667
aV@GeoffreySupran @nytimes what about the argument that CO2 emissions will now increase due to truck and rail transport of that oil?
p2668
aV@RamsesEstrada2 @jmartNYT gracias (though I still don't get it!)
p2669
aV@jmartNYT what does #ff mean?
p2670
aV@farmerrf @NYTimeskrugman is that an original concept?  Seems extremely obvious and elementary that demand creates supply.
p2671
aVBuckner's ghost is clearly haunting the right side of the infield at Citi.  #buckner #MetsvsRoyals #WorldSeries #DanielMurphy #Royals
p2672
aV@stlouisfed so they're free?
p2673
aV@jimcramer great on-air analysis of Carson's nonsensical answer on the issue.  And nice work last night!
p2674
aV@davidfrum stupid questions??  Cramer asked how to deal with drug price gouging.  Carson answered LESS regulation!!  Huh?!
p2675
aV@davidaxelrod @marcorubio how much $ does investment income tax bring in annually?
p2676
aV@alansmurray @SPENCE_JOHN @ron_fournier Alan, I circulated a link to the BLS #s in an earlier tweet.
p2677
aV@alansmurray @HarvardWinters @carletonenglish here's the link to the article re BLS stats:  https://t.co/inQr29LBUt
p2678
aV@alansmurray @HarvardWinters @carletonenglish what do you make of the BLS statistics that the previous article links to?
p2679
aV@thehill hah no
p2680
aV@davidfrum ahh of course.  What was I thinking.
p2681
aV@realDonaldTrump @BillKristol @Morning_Joe what is he even talking about??
p2682
aV@davidfrum why can't it nominate Cruz?
p2683
aV@levie when is Box opening up shop?
p2684
aV@mtaibbi funnier than an onion article
p2685
aV@KateMcElheney @davidfrum yeah bc he has stopped doing damage as prez
p2686
aV@davidfrum @politico how about the fact that people don't want another Bush in office?  People seem to forget his brother had 30% approval
p2687
aV@BillKristol @realDonaldTrump @msbul bill what's with the Trump hatred?
p2688
aV@BillKristol @reaIDonaldTrunp @RealBenCarson @costareports. Trump is desperate?  Pretty sure you're the only one who thinks that Bill
p2689
aV@jasian12345 why?
p2690
aV@jasian12345 so you're not conservative?  Or you are?  I'm confused
p2691
aV@KhouryGarrett @JohnJHarwood how so?
p2692
aV@jimcramer might these FANG earnings turn the whole market around?  After hrs today was just huge.
p2693
aV@McFaul @JohnJHarwood the line of questioning from Pompeo was just absurd.  He's a Harvard Law grad?!
p2694
aV@MCaruso_Cabrera @GrantMBeasley gotta say, after watching that whole thing I'm still unclear on what his talent is?
p2695
aV@MCaruso_Cabrera I recognize that Pitbull has his finger in a lot of pots, but has anyone seen the P&amp;L?  Are any of the businesses making $?
p2696
aV@kevinolearytv nice!  How was the Klein book?
p2697
aV@BellamyYoung favorite drink while watching a Scandal episode??
p2698
aV@tonygoldwyn what kind of bourbon??
p2699
aV@PaulBegala why is this still going on??!
p2700
aV@AguadoKambarov why are you posting this?
p2701
aV@paulvigna fair point!
p2702
aV@paulvigna true, but the joke that the Cubs are hopeless is still funny.
p2703
aV@TonyFratto @JohnJHarwood @NFL the game is doomed?  Have you checked out the recent attendance, viewership or revenue #s?
p2704
aV@davidfrum I guess bc Trump attacks him more than Carson does.  He's trying to avoid being seen as a weakling.
p2705
aV@nickconfessore incredible
p2706
aV@adammesh it was?  I think it was a lot lower in 1980...
p2707
aV@ByronYork maybe it's time for Jeb to step aside?
p2708
aV@mtaibbi @realDonaldTrump agree but you must admit you're starting to think Trump may actually do this...
p2709
aV@chucktodd would love to hear the argument that Fiorina or Carson (35% of the vote) is more qualified than Lincoln Chaffee (&lt;1%)!  Ideas??
p2710
aV@chucktodd query -- is Lincoln chafee more qualified than any single Republican candidate?  I think there's a reasonable case...
p2711
aV@jess_roland totally hear you!  Opinions are always a good thing :)
p2712
aV@Bethenny btw I'm sure you already know this but Hill would love your endorsement and you should get active if not already!  Repubs are weak
p2713
aV@jess_roland just questioning you re your tweets.  If that's not allowed let me know...
p2714
aV@nikkileigh24 @Bethenny @jess_roland huh?
p2715
aV@jess_roland so natl security is your #1 issue?
p2716
aV@jess_roland so the economy more important than protecting natl security?
p2717
aV@Bethenny @jess_roland what do you care more abt than national security?
p2718
aV@Germananja @Bethenny @jess_roland but she knew they could be classified.  Why take the chance?
p2719
aV@realDonaldTrump Hillary keeps mentioning her life 40 years ago.  So i guess we can ask her about Whitewater and all those cattle futures?
p2720
aV@Bethenny @jess_roland yeah it's being investigated and they keep finding that she emailed a ton of classified info.  u don't care?
p2721
aV@samsteinhp is that supposed to be funny?
p2722
aV@Bethenny @BernieSanders @HillaryClinton so do you think she's genuine?

aV@RealMichaelKay any chance Cashman just gets fired?  He's a horrible gm

aV@SteveMartinToGo I don't get it (?)
p2726
aV@SenJohnMcCain @nfergus @WSJ so basically, lawyers are incapable of conducting effective foreign policy?  Confusing analysis by Ferguson

aV@deanjnorris is that a haiku?  It's brilliant
p2728
aV@mrglu yeah instacart def did work great a year ago.  I was optimistic but now I'm not sure.  Hope they can recover
p2729
aV@mrglu yup.  someone also thought same abt kozmo and webvan
p2730
aV@mrglu I guess but if they can't find enough shoppers there goes the "insta" (along w company's reputation)
p2731
aV@mrglu @Instacart I think they were able to float by on generous VC $ for awhile but the core economics don't really work
p2732
aV@mrglu @Instacart company is a joke in NYC!!
p2733
aV@420nerd @Reince cool idea!  And how do you suggest the government collect tax revenue?
p2734
aV@larry_kudlow @mikemerc57 @batchelorshow @philizzo p.s.  If you have a detailed alternative to Obamacare I'd love to read it!
p2735
aV@larry_kudlow @mikemerc57 @batchelorshow @philizzo as author argues, job-creating provisions of ACA didn't kick in till 2014...
p2736
aV@larry_kudlow @mikemerc57 @batchelorshow @philizzo totally wrong.  Major job growth in the industry.  http://t.co/tThoTLuqbT
p2737
aV@larry_kudlow @batchelorshow @philizzo lower oil takes awhile to kick in, and consumer spending very strong in Aug.  Bodes well.
p2738
aV@larry_kudlow @mikemerc57 @batchelorshow @philizzo depressant on growth??  Tell that to the hospital, insurance and biotech industries...
p2739
aV@mikemerc57 @larry_kudlow @batchelorshow @philizzo at least you acknowledge that obamacare has helped the economy grow
p2740
aV@larry_kudlow @batchelorshow @philizzo profits falling?  What abt NKE, AAPL, PEP, etc etc??
p2741
aV@Reince Hmm.  IRS has 90k emplyees.  $6M over 5 yrs = $13 per emplyee/yr.   How is that disgraceful?  Shld govt employees not get bonuses?
p2742
aV@Instacart Same day or even next day delivery STILL not available in NYC!!  How is this at all acceptable for a company based on "insta"?!
p2743
aV@tvmay2 @marklevinshow yup but they sure do like to criticize and offer no solutions
p2744
aV@sbrenn01 @marklevinshow right, you've said that repeatedly.  So what now?
p2745
aV@PureMitten @brithume @MrDewMaster @thehill are you being serious right now?  Or perhaps you're just mentally slow??
p2746
aV@PureMitten @brithume @MrDewMaster @thehill exactly.  Not complicated.  So...umm what?

aV@PureMitten @brithume @MrDewMaster @thehill not all.  Only the top 57%!!
p2748
aV@PureMitten @brithume @MrDewMaster @thehill umm, what?
p2749
aV@PureMitten @brithume @MrDewMaster @thehill gee great point!  Who cares if they are insane narcissistic failures.  At least no FBI!!
p2750
aV@MrDewMaster @brithume @thehill I'm "offering" someone?  News to me, but thanks!!
p2751
aV@brithume @MrDewMaster @thehill right.  A huckster, a failed businesswoman, and a doc who doesn't believe in evolution.  Awesome crowd!
p2752
aV@brithume @MrDewMaster @thehill why is that BS Brit?  Do you think the GOP has great candidates?
p2753
aV@EasterbrookG @politico @POLITICOMag guess all Im saying is that even if theres deterrent val it still wouldnt help "guns make us safer" arg
p2754
aV@EasterbrookG @politico @POLITICOMag would be curious to see any data on this...
p2755
aV@EasterbrookG @politico @POLITICOMag doubt the gun-showing deterrent has meaningful value.  (And Europe achieves zero gun violence w/o it)
p2756
aV@sbrenn01 @marklevinshow so no ideas from you on what to do now.  Too bad.
p2757
aV@sbrenn01 @marklevinshow thanks Steve.  And do what exactly right now?

aV@pthny @BilldeBlasio @Ntl_Homeless and thanks for that fact sheet!
p2779
aV@pthny @BilldeBlasio @Ntl_Homeless that 26% # is from 12 yrs ago.  Heroin use has gotten much worse since then and I wonder what impact is
p2780
aV@pthny @BilldeBlasio Can you point me to some stats on what % are not on drugs?  Thanks.
p2781
aV@BilldeBlasio I agree.  Is there any plan to get them drug treatment?  Drug addiction lies at the root of this...
p2782
aV@realDonaldTrump I thought you said to go in and "take the oil"?  Did the Economist interview misquote you?
p2783
aV@TooBeMused_ @nytimes oh?  If you could point me to those interviews I'd be curious
p2784
aV@nytimes have you done similar factfinding/interviewing re Hillary and Bill Clinton's parents' records?
p2785
aV@nytimes his fathers arrest is newsworthy?  Strange
p2786
aV@BRyvkin @AlexisinNH umm, ok.
p2787
aV@BRyvkin @AlexisinNH he said we should affirmatively go in.  No 'if's there.  See economist intvw from a few weeks ago.
p2788
aV@BRyvkin @AlexisinNH he didn't say "if".  Said he wants to go back in and "take the oil". (Whatever that even means)
p2789
aV@BRyvkin @AlexisinNH wrong.  Said he wants to "go in" and "take the oil".
p2790
aV@BRyvkin @AlexisinNH he's referring to what he wants done now.  Do you think it's hawkish to send in troops now to "take the oil"?
p2791
aV@BRyvkin @AlexisinNH hmm.  Going into Iraq and "taking their oil" is not a hawkish stance?
p2792
aV@sebhth @hblodget @realDonaldTrump I just wish people would stop calling it a 'loophole' bc it's really not one.

p2802
aV@NateWatkins @Bob_Croft bush only unlimited if the donors stay onboard.  After 2 dreadful debates they may jump to Kasich
p2803
aV@NateWatkins @Bob_Croft trump will need to spnd $ to fend off the attck ads and he doesn't want to brn his own $.  I think he fades evntualy
p2804
aV@NateWatkins @Bob_Croft the GOP usually settles on a reasonable candidate.  If they're smart it will be him
p2805
aV@Bob_Croft @NateWatkins Kasich I guess.  Least nonsensical and prob best track record on stage
p2806

p2822
aV@Instacart @apoorva_mehta any word on this?  I thought same-day was the whole point of your company, no?

aV@NowakowskiA @pmarca no idea but would love to see the statistics!
p2863
aV@NowakowskiA @pmarca I have no idea.  Was merely pointing out that Murdoch didn't properly address trumps claim
p2864
aV@NowakowskiA @pmarca not sure what you mean by "all groups of immigrants".  Does that include immigrants who've been convicted of crimes?
p2865
aV@NowakowskiA @pmarca Murdoch said the crime rate for "all immigrants" is low.  Fine but illegals are a subset that could have a higher rate
p2866
aV@NowakowskiA @pmarca it does include illegal, but the crime rate for "all" and the rate for "illegal" are two different things
p2867
aV@pmarca @Noahpinion @rupertmurdoch then he should specify "illegal" instead of "all"
p2868
aV@Noahpinion @pmarca @rupertmurdoch he doesn't even address Trump's claim, which is that illegal immigrants commit crimes at higher rates...
