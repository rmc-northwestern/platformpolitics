aV@VintageJonathan @MaddowBlog @MSNBC If the knee jerk reaction is to obstruct even if candidate qualified Dems may start losing credibility
p979
aV@MaddowBlog @MSNBC Is he a horrible pick or is this just obstruct to obstruct because the Repubs did? Don't know if that's a good strategy.
p980
aV@RawStory If I don't ever have to listen to the Propaganda Minister Kellyanne Conjob lie again on CNN that's incentive to watch it more.
p981
aV@realDonaldTrump Try not picking people with absolutely no experience or expertise or haven't sued the agency u want them to run.
p982
aV@davidfolkenflik She knew the consequences of her actions and did it anyway. We need more people like her to stand up to Trump.
p983
aV@CNBC This does not come as a surprise but I thank her for doing the right thing despite the personal consequences.
p984
aVRT @nytimes: The acting attorney general has ordered the Justice Department not to defend President Trump's immigration order https://t.co/\u2026
p985
aV@jan_tru Your gram was full of useless overly simplistic advice. I'm not the naive one. U don't even understand why women chose as they do.
p986
aV@C_Brusca Sorry about that!
p987
aV@jan_tru @C_Brusca Actually that advice is unrealistic, overly simplistic and wrong.  I doubt u understand the reasons women abort.
p988
aV@jan_tru @C_Brusca And when are you going to tell men to keep it in their shorts? Why is it always women who are too blame?
p989
aV@jan_tru @C_Brusca You quote a tired piece of useless advice that fails to acknowledge the actual realities of women who utilize abortion.
p990
aV@jan_tru @C_Brusca Good to hear your grandmother was never raped and had a choice in the matter. Others aren't so lucky.

aVThese are the people we're turning away. This isn't keeping us safer. https://t.co/fVAf0Nyzht
p993
aV@jan_tru @C_Brusca @KimboDiddleyDoo Also my point was that men really shouldn't get to say what women do with their bodies.
p994
aV@jan_tru @C_Brusca @KimboDiddleyDoo U may want to check the law on that. The male half can't force the pregnancy.
p995
aV@C_Brusca It's not about convenience and if that embryo was self sustaining on the moon perhaps it is life.
p996
aV@C_Brusca @moynes Sometimes it's not about stopping but slowing. I'd take slowing at this point.
p997
aV@C_Brusca @moynes It's felt like forever. I thank you for being respectful. :)
p998
aV@C_Brusca @jan_tru @KimboDiddleyDoo Actually legally a fertilized embryo has none. That's part of the debate.
p999
aV@C_Brusca @moynes Given the lethality of handguns I want people properly vetted and trained before owning one. If it takes longer so be it.
p1000
aV@jan_tru @C_Brusca @KimboDiddleyDoo Opinion is fine but righting a law that restricts other people's rights is not ok.
p1001
aV@C_Brusca @moynes @washingtonpost I work in immigration law and I've helped pro bono asylum cases. These people are put through the ringer.
p1002
aV@C_Brusca @moynes The actual reason is that it happens every new admin. Old archived and new President can put what he wants.
p1003
aV@C_Brusca @moynes Dude I'm a former cop. Own a gun fine but train with it, secure it and start enforcing laws we have or get ones that work.
p1004
aV@moynes @C_Brusca The entire site was archived when new administration came in. Trump has nothing to post so there is nothing there.
p1005
aV@C_Brusca @moynes It means those nasty people can't sit and plot where to send operatives. No guarantee where or if they will get to US.
p1006
aV@moynes @C_Brusca Significantly more then terrorists did but obviously gun crime isn't as big a threat as refugees per Trump.
p1007
aV@C_Brusca @moynes Weer these all US attacks? You realize it takes 2 years to get through the process &amp; they don't pick the country?
p1008
aV@C_Brusca @moynes Actually how the world views us and our neighbor countries is relevant. They see what's happening &amp; it effects them to.
p1009
aV@C_Brusca @moynes Not a single refugee we've admitted has been a part of any terrorist activity. Those we turned away today were vetted.

aVRT @HamillHimself: #UnAmerican https://t.co/NRgmhchRYF
p1011
aV@C_Brusca @KimboDiddleyDoo U aren't the women who has to carry that child to term when it was began in violence.
p1012
aV@C_Brusca @KimboDiddleyDoo U realize u can say that because u don't have to live with the consequences of the law u want passed right?
p1013
aV@C_Brusca @KimboDiddleyDoo Really? Rape and incest is ok? It does matter and u should know why women do in order to help if really prolife.
p1014
aV@C_Brusca @KimboDiddleyDoo And u really have a myopic view of the topic and are uneducated about why women get abortions.
p1015
aV@C_Brusca @KimboDiddleyDoo I'm sorry now you're being obtuse. I want to give women a chance to decide that, u want to take it away.
p1016
aV@C_Brusca @KimboDiddleyDoo I didn't see ur answer. U can't force men to be fathers. Shouldn't force women to be mothers either.
p1017
aV@C_Brusca @KimboDiddleyDoo And when life begins is a question that has yet to be answered definitively. U don't get to decide that for all.
p1018
aV@C_Brusca @KimboDiddleyDoo How is a guy being in jail for not supporting his kids going to help? How about letting women make their choices.
p1019
aV@C_Brusca @KimboDiddleyDoo Men also have the choice to keep it in their shorts but women end up taking the lion share of the responsibility.
p1020
aV@C_Brusca @KimboDiddleyDoo U went there and used a common trope. U should stop limiting women's choice. Pick a men's health issue to rally.
p1021
aV@C_Brusca @KimboDiddleyDoo I know about statistics on women who choose abortive services. How silly of u to think a woman can't research
p1022
aV@C_Brusca @KimboDiddleyDoo U don't understand those who obtain abortions if that's what u really believe. It's not about convenience at all
p1023
aV@C_Brusca @KimboDiddleyDoo Point and you're a man trying tell women what they and can't do with their bodies. It's their choice not yours.
p1024
aV@C_Brusca @KimboDiddleyDoo Why do men think they have the right to decide what a woman may choose to do with her body?

aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust You're starting to sound like an ex that can't figure out the relationship is over and keeps trying
p1081
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust Yesterday I tweeted that u weren't going to convince me since u can't prove you point.
p1082
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust You have cited a single source that proves anything.
p1083
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust I believe you have us confused. I don't believe every non conservative media source lies.
p1084
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust Citation I said a Liberal lie please or that I'm brainwashed please.
p1085
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust U also can't figure out this ended along time ago. That's a reminder of ur inability to see reality.
p1086
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust All u proved is that u couldn't figure out that you can't prove I said any liberal lies.
p1087
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust I don't think you had a point to start with other then to accuse people of saying liberal lies.
p1088
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust There is no citation to show your lack of logical thought. Review the tweet thread.
p1089
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust I've explained this, u failed to grasp the concept. That's not deflection that's your problem.
p1090
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust The person who tweeted liberal lies &amp; brainwashing is making comments about sources. That's funny.
p1091
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust No one buys your either.
p1092
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust Your utter failure to grasp basic logic explains so much.
p1093
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust Citation please.
p1094
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust Your statements haven't been backed by proof so no one believes you either. You're not an expert.
p1095
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust You did prove 1 thing. Your opinion and your conspiracies don't matter to me.
p1096
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust Enjoy your Breitbart all other media lies to you island. What a supremely narrow world view. Good day
p1097
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust Normally I learn some from tweeter exchanges. Not in this case. Confirmed my theory.
p1098
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust LIberal media lie is your parrot response.
p1099
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust U obviously believe in the liberal media conspiracy myth. U won't prove to me it exists.
p1100
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust You proved nothing since your source offered tangential links with no direct connection to anything.
p1101
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust You just want to ignore that there is a Conservative bias so u can try to act morally superior.
p1102
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust Apparently you don't know. I don't have to prove what I said wasn't u have to prove what I said was.
p1103
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust I think this sums up your entire problem. if you're saying one is biased then so is the other. Logic.
p1104
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust U tweeted stop saying liberal lies yet you can't prove what I tweeted was a liberal lie. Amazing!
p1105
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust U said conservative owned sites aren't biased but liberal are.That defies logic.Don't need a cite.
p1106
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust You've asked no questions. U told me to stop telling liberal lies. Said I was brainwashed. Prove it.
p1107
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust Once again, u tweeted me and provided no proof of any statement I made was a liberal lie.
p1108
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust Get used to it. I've explained you have failed to comprehend. Not my problem.
p1109
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust Nope, just wondering when you'll have something other then Breitbart that actually is proof.
p1110
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust Is this your impression of a broken record?
p1111
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust But I get the distinct impression you don't know what proof actually is.
p1112
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust Citation for what?The fact your articles showed no proof. You could read it and see that.
p1113
aV@Popehat I would pay to see that.
p1114
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust You cited nothing that was actual proof of anything, it was supposition at best. Learn the difference
p1115
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust I'm still waiting for you to prove I posted liberal lies. I guess we'll both be waiting for a while.
p1116
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust U tweeted at a stranger to stop telling liberal lies as if that was a real thing. U lost at the start
p1117
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust I'm waiting for you to cite something that's actual proof. I'll probably be retired before then.
p1118
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust Why did u bother? Probably because u think your opinion is more right then mine. It's not.
p1119
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust U challenged my statement up to u to prove it's a lie. U felt compelled to tweet a complete stranger.
p1120
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust You continue to miss the point.U tweeted a complete stranger that a comment made was a lie.
p1121
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust Especially since it's not true.
p1122
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust I'm sure most times when type that no one says anything back. I'm not most people. Not accepting it.
p1123
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust No lies have been told by me. This is always your fallback when challenged.
p1124
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust You cited no studies and no proof just bias alt right Breitbart articles.
p1125
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust U tweeted stating I was saying a Liberal lie which I wasn't and u couldn't prove.
p1126
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust You're the 1 telling me I'm voting based on being brainwashed by the mythical lying liberal media.
p1127
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust You proved no point. Conservative bias isn't better then Liberal. No side is better then the other.
p1128
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust Just because a source is liberal doesn't mean it's biased either.
p1129
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust You tweeted to me so it's yours to prove since u think your way is right and mine wrong.
p1130
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust Expressing it's conservative spin to it. Also you're the one telling I think wrong. Then u prove it.
p1131
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust When your research appears to only be Breitbart I believe you have the research problem.
p1132
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust I recommend the same to you.
p1133
aV@realDonaldTrump And we know this is an unaltered email how? Did your Russian friends assure you they didn't change anything?
p1134
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust Perhaps you should do some on the myth of the liberal media lies.
p1135
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust Haven't read that from the New York times.
p1136
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNYIf If u believe in such a thing as liberal media bias u believe a conspiracy theory.
p1137
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY A conspiracy it can't prove exists without readers suspending common sense.
p1138
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY That makes no sense. Breitbart tells its readers everyone else is part of a conspiracy.
p1139
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY When it tells its readers that its the only thing telling u the truth u should be wary.
p1140
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY Based on your remarks you follow the Breitbart Koolaid windowless van of conspiracies.
p1141
aV@SophieInCT @Spartacussin @cate_long It's totally possible for her to be a Yankees fan and appreciate the Cubs victory and moment in history
p1142
aV@JeffreyToobin Pinch yourself, Cubs in the World Series. It's not a dream, it's really happening!!!
p1143
aV@wilw GO CUBS GO!!!!! Maybe next year Dodgers. :)
p1144
aV@wilw Not this year!
p1145
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY I'm not brainwashed, I have my own thoughts and opinions and no one controls me.
p1146
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY Maybe one day you'll figure out ur on the wrong side.Once u stop listening to Breitbart
p1147
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY Yes I do thank you.
p1148
aV@BigTwen I'm going to watch the Cubs now, who I hope will be awesome tonight. :)
p1149
aV@BigTwen You know Navy won again today. :)
p1150
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY I think for myself everyday &amp; ignore those who think they should tell me how to think.
p1151
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY I hope some day u look beyond conspiracy theories and realize who is really lying to u.
p1152
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY I know what I am and whether you believe that is of no consequence to me.
p1153
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY There are people who are capable of forming opinions based on actual experiences.
p1154
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY That's my opinion based on listening to live streams of his rallies and the debates.
p1155
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY Trump is not a qualified to be President.That opinion based on his own words &amp; actions.
p1156
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY Telling the truth isn't calling everything liberal lies.
p1157
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY Sounds like they're covering Trump appropriately. When Hillary does things they cover
p1158
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY So because Trump makes ignorant racist statements he gets more attention from the media
p1159
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY You're the one who keeps telling I'm wrong so show your sources. That's how it works.
p1160
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY No victim here. U were the one who tweeted at me and I challenged you.
p1161
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY Oh you lost when you kept calling me liberal like it was an insult. You had no facts!
p1162
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY You lost the minute you called me a troll &amp; brainwashed. You went personnel. U lost.
p1163
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY Actually its not anti Trump. They have written extensively on both, both good and bad.
p1164
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY You can't prove people are brainwashed, you can't prove those women lied.
p1165
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY Actually the nonsense that was written came from you.
p1166
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY I asked about what was the media brainwashing u claim and you gave a nonsensical answer
p1167
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY U believe lies are beliefs that don't align with yours. I'm not the brainwashed 1.
p1168
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY I've told no lies at all just asked questions and questioned your supposed stances.
p1169
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY You're points are hollow, your facts are not and you just regurgitate Trump token lines
p1170
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY You're only defense has been to claim I'm brainwashed because I don't agree with you.
p1171
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY U repeatedly parrot liberal media lie as if its an actual thing.
p1172
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY U actually started this out by calling me brainwashed and tossing liberal  lie around
p1173
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY I actually asked you questions and you repeated the conspiracy theorist Trump playbook
p1174
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY Which point do you want facts on?
p1175
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY I have no alt left agenda. I have no agenda other then Trump isn't fit to be President
p1176
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY In no way have I trolled you, I've challenged your positions. Sorry u can't defend them
p1177
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY So if Conservative owned isn't biased then why is Democratic controlled biased?
p1178
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY Yes because they don't fit the Alt Right agenda Breitbart pushes.
p1179
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY Reading the articles and finding them utterly devoid of actual facts and sources.
p1180
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY It does make them biased just as you've made claims of bias about the liberal media.
p1181
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY What lies did I tell? You use Breitbart and Truthfeed as sources. Those aren't credible
p1182
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY Breitbart has an agenda of pushing Conservative values. They are very very biased.
p1183
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY From what I see you only read Conservative bent sites that aren't necessarily news.
p1184
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY I read both positive and negative of both candidates from multiple credible sources.
p1185
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY That's not proof she lied that's supposition.Not being booked at the hotel ect is proof
p1186
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY I'm not the one claiming Liberals are more violent. I don't have to show a site. U do.
p1187
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY No you chose not to believe because it doesn't conform to your narrative.
p1188
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY @HillaryClinton And no more so then you if you think Breitbart credible.
p1189
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY @HillaryClinton No I just don't buy the conspiracy theories and grand scheming.
p1190
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY @HillaryClinton So docs that lack authenticity is your supposed source
p1191
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY @HillaryClinton HP makes it clear in the bottom of their political articles.
p1192
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY @HillaryClinton I don't think I'm the ignorant at all.
p1193
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY @HillaryClinton Do u have statistics on that or is that what Breitbart tells u to think
p1194
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY How about you look outside your conspiracies? You're stuck in conspiracy land.
p1195
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY @HillaryClinton She writes about wellness and yoga! Not even politics.
p1196
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY @HillaryClinton This isn't proof.Simply working at the Huffington doesn't mean a lie
p1197
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY Wide awake.Nothing offered to dispute these claims by Trump. Nothing but "They lie".
p1198
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY @HillaryClinton You have no proof he didn't assault these women. Doubtful all are lying
p1199
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY @HillaryClinton Breitbart doesn't report news but creates &amp; supports conspiracies.
p1200
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY @HillaryClinton You use liberal like its an insult. Its not 1 anymore then conservative
p1201
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY @HillaryClinton I fit neither party. I have both conservative and liberal leanings.
p1202
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY @HillaryClinton This is Breitbart so its not unbiased &amp; no about claims of sex assault
p1203
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY No but when I investigate a claim I either find proof that person lied or I don't.
p1204
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY @TruthFeedNews I wouldn't exactly call this proof or posted on an unbiased site.
p1205
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY @TruthFeedNews So this is a Trump supported site,quoting a supposed relative. Skeptical
p1206
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY @HillaryClinton Does that mean you live in a Conservative fantasy world?
p1207
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY Pence said there would be proof given last week and I'm still waiting.
p1208
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY Victims should be believed unless there is proof to indicate they lied.
p1209
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @MarkSimoneNY Could you post a link to it, I haven't found it and I have looked.
p1210
aV@RR2sand @LovesTheJust @BangkokmalCook @MarkSimoneNY @HillaryClinton Not your decision who is really a Catholic.
p1211
aV@RR2sand @LovesTheJust @BangkokmalCook  @MarkSimoneNY @HillaryClinton My parish has Democrats,Republicans and Independents.
p1212
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @sav01 @MarkSimoneNY Trump has offered nothing but him stating they lie. That's not proof.
p1213
aV@BangkokmalCook @RR2sand @LovesTheJust @sav01 @MarkSimoneNY No proof has been offered to disprove them. Witness have come forward to verify.
p1214
aV@RR2sand @LovesTheJust @BangkokmalCook @sav01 @MarkSimoneNY @HillaryClinton Where do you come by that authority?
p1215
aV@RR2sand @LovesTheJust @BangkokmalCook  @MarkSimoneNY @HillaryClinton Somehow you believe you can dictate who is and who isn't a Catholic.
p1216
aV@RR2sand @LovesTheJust @BangkokmalCook  @MarkSimoneNY @HillaryClinton It's nice for you that the world is so simple but that's not reality.
p1217
aV@RR2sand @LovesTheJust @BangkokmalCook @sav01 @MarkSimoneNY @HillaryClinton Too many other issues that effect the living also need attention
p1218
aV@RR2sand @LovesTheJust @BangkokmalCook @sav01 @MarkSimoneNY @HillaryClinton This is why I am not a single issue voter despite being pro life
p1219
aV@RR2sand @LovesTheJust @BangkokmalCook @sav01 @MarkSimoneNY @HillaryClinton Do Catholics believe in treating people with respect &amp; dignity?
p1220
aV@RR2sand @LovesTheJust @BangkokmalCook @sav01 @MarkSimoneNY @HillaryClinton A Catholic believes ALL life is sacred, not just the unborn.
p1221
aV@BangkokmalCook For you does this same standard apply to the Conservative leaning media? There is bias from both in my opinion.
p1222
aV@RR2sand @LovesTheJust @BangkokmalCook @sav01 @MarkSimoneNY @HillaryClinton Or a racist, or a bigot, or a mysoginst and that's Trump.
p1223
aV@RR2sand @LovesTheJust @BangkokmalCook @sav01 @MarkSimoneNY @HillaryClinton A Catholic shouldn't vote for a man who gropes women either.
p1224
aV@BangkokmalCook How does the media brainwash people? I've heard this before but no one has explained how that happens.
p1225
aV@BangkokmalCook I think it's more a lack of healthy skepticism, to question the source and validity. And inability to read different opinion
p1226
aV@BangkokmalCook I should clarify, why do you call them uninformed simply because they don't agree with you?
p1227
aV@BangkokmalCook Then why do feel the need to respond and call people names like narrow-minded? It appears you do care since you responded.
p1228
aV@BangkokmalCook @BraddJaffy Hardly brainwashed. I accept the negatives of the candidate I chose. Many polls and Republicans said he lost.
p1229
aV@BangkokmalCook I don't believe I need to justify or prove up my vote to you or anyone. You have no idea why I've formed my opinion.
p1230
aV@RR2sand @LovesTheJust @BangkokmalCook @sav01 @MarkSimoneNY @HillaryClinton Listen to what he says. How is he even Christian?
p1231
aV@RR2sand @LovesTheJust @BangkokmalCook @sav01 @MarkSimoneNY @HillaryClinton I'm not a single issue voter. He does not represent Catholics.
p1232
aV@RR2sand @LovesTheJust @BangkokmalCook @sav01 @MarkSimoneNY @HillaryClinton I didn't say that at all. No way can I vote Trump.
p1233
aV@BraddJaffy Who wrote this for him? It's horrible. None of this was funny.
p1234
aV@RR2sand @LovesTheJust @BangkokmalCook @sav01 @MarkSimoneNY @HillaryClinton Proudly Catholic and voting for Hilary. Easy decision this year.
p1235
aV@realDonaldTrump You were 1st runner up.
p1236

p1240
aVRT @NathanFillion: How do we fact check the tremendous hatred in someone's heart? #debate

aVWise counsel. https://t.co/uyXgRrEG2C
p1246
aV@realDonaldTrump Great, the tweets can tell us all in real time what you really meant to say since you can't articulate anything.
p1247
aV@KellyannePolls @HillaryClinton At one point I thought Kellanne still had a soul, now I see you don't. You're desperate and hes a pig.
p1248
aV@realDonaldTrump He did do better then you but a jr high debate team could do better then you. They at least prepare beforehand.
p1249
aVRT @MartinaClarkNYC: Clinton Foundation saved countless lives of people with HIV. Pence cut funding and allowed an epidemic in his state. #\u2026
p1250
aV@realDonaldTrump Kaine's approval ratings were very high while Governor and Senator. IN couldn't wait to get rid of Pence. He was horrible.
p1251
aV@TeamTrump @mike_pence @realDonaldTrump aka must be male. Poor Donald, your sexism is showing again.
p1252
aV@realDonaldTrump Just because you use your foundation as piggy bank doesn't mean the Clinton's are. Not everyone is as crooked as you are.
p1253
aV@missmorenab Short, simple and right on!
p1254
aV@AnneWheaton There are rules to war, surprisingly, but since Trump doesn't follow rules he doesn't know we can't do that.
p1255
aVAnd it was effective. I have a set, passed down through the generations. https://t.co/baOPMICwku
p1256
aV@realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton Stop interrupting her and shouting. Being the loudest doesn't make you right. You've lied multiple times.
p1257
aVThis is about how feel about the entire season... https://t.co/J07wD0JeIS
p1258
aV@pwkad @wilw And people died senselessly today due to gun violence. Its wrong not to speak about that and be upset. Freedom of speech FTW!

aV@wilw We should be congratulating all our medal winners not minimizing their achievements or belittling them or their sport.
p1264
aV@scalzi Twitter needs more cats and kittens to offset all the Trump tweets. Thank you!
p1265
aV@realDonaldTrump If you think that was vicious wait till the debates. Oh wait, you're trying to dodge those to just like Vietnam.
p1266
aV@Popehat Had a similar reaction. Loved the character pairings and Jaylah but felt like this turned a little bit into Trek Fast &amp; Furious.
p1267
aV@wilw That's how they get you! She's so cute and fluffy!

aV@GordonRamsay please wear a seat belt when driving! I didn't see you wearing 1 on Hotel Hell.
p1272
aV@PeterOrlowicz and having your wife a few hours closer would make things near perfect.
p1273
aV@PeterOrlowicz Hopefully it will be up and running soon with no slow downd during WoW anymore. :)

p1277
aV@PeterOrlowicz I misplaced my seeing eye dog somewhere in the Kingdom of Twitter

aVBeing schooled on how to use Twitter by my husband over gchat. Irony anyone?
