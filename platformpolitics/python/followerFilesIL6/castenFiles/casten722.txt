aV@mnowc michigan seems to be in regardless. MSU however... #pleasedontcallitaplayingame
p841
aV@mnowc It'll be so satisfying to lose in Dayton next week #pleasedontcallitaplayingame
p842
aV@mnowc Cmon Iowa, put em out of their misery. MSU has been waiting all season to be put down. #sweepthelegjohnny
p843
aV@KCJHoop Didn't they clinch the division too?
p844
aV@CarmenDeFalco RT @Escoot Opened at 130, bet down to 127. Lots of numbers to land on in-between.
p845
aV@ryenarussillo very efficient clutchness by Kevin Martin at the end of the Hou-Phx game. Didn't touch the ball so his stats remain the same
p846
aV@WaddleandSilvy be careful, I think he's still taking mental notes...
p847
aV@dougthonus will/should Bulls sign Corey Brewer? Ideal fit? No. Guy with pedigree/upside from bad situation? Yes
p848
aV@RobHatcher32 @mnowc @dangelop I stopped watching. HERE WE GO THUNDER!!!
p849
aV@mnowc @RobHatcher32 @dangelop where is paaauull?? clap clap clapclapclap
p850
aV@mnowc @RobHatcher32 not making the tournament, that's for sure
p851
aV@RobHatcher32 @mnowc @dangelop I DONT KNOW WHAT WE'RE YELLING ABOUT!!!
p852
aV@RobHatcher32 @dangelop Wake up Paul!!
p853
aV@RobHatcher32 Will you buyout Richard Hamilton already
p854
aV@robhatcher32 Bears &gt; Lions
p855
aV@hatche12 Bears &gt; Lions
p856
aV@ESPNChiBulls at least they have backup big men for 12 minutes per game though
p857
aV@BullsBlogger Isn't mcroberts bad? Bulls really wouldn't trump McRoberts and a pick in the mid teens?
p858
aV@BullsBlogger What's that infatuation with Anthony Parker? Isn't he basically Keith Bogans but from Naperville?
p859
aV@WaddleandSilvy more important: insurance/depth or a 35 mpg SG? Mayo is worth Asik/2-1sts. You can get a buyout guy for big man depth
p860
aV@WaddleandSilvy 5 minutes into our first episode of Pawn Stars, wife says "I'm already hooked"
p861
aV@Chris_Broussard What about Afflalo?  Bulls need him at the 2.
p862
aV@sportsguy33 your giant head is on TV during the anthem. Just thought you should know
p863
aV@WaddleandSilvy heard you got married! Congrats!!!
p864
aV@WojYahooNBA is Afflalo gonna be available?
p865
aV@CarmenDeFalco @AfternoonSaloon ZEDERMAN
p866
aV@ESPNChiBulls Bogans for 3! Who had 6:49 in the office pool?
p867
aV@WaddleandSilvy LET'S GO CAVS!!
p868
aV@ESPNChiBulls So you think HOU wants more than Asik and the paper says Bulls won't do Asik for Lee straight. Seems like Lee is staying put.
p869
aV@WaddleandSilvy Best thing that could happen to them is short run of losses like these--&gt;trades, lineup changes. Winning teams don't tinker
p870
aV@MatthewBerryTMR using BCS logic it does. Congrats!
p871
aV@Chris_Broussard That deal sounds like its straight off the Knicks message boards. Wolves might as well send Kevin Love to NY too
p872
aV@hoopshype Noah
p873
aV@sportsguy33 at least you're not staring at your blackberry...@STEIN_LINE_HQ: RT @kbrissy: close-up of simmons http://yfrog.com/h453xyrj
p874
aV@KCJHoop I've heard he's targetting the Miami game on 2/24. Good guess?
p875
aV@sportsguy33 Whats wrong with JVG and Mark Jackson? Garnett CLEARLY hits him in the sack. That validates at least the first technical.
p876
aV@KyleKorver 210 Go Bulls!
p877
aV@STEIN_LINE_HQ does this make Mayo easier or harder to trade for?
p878
aV@chadmillman What is the 2011 Madden rating of the player to score the first touchdown?
p879
aV@ESPNChiBears Safe to say Bears need OL, DT, WR, CB...do you think they draft OT, OG, C, or DT 1st? How much does Kruetz have left?
p880
aV@WaddleandSilvy McNabb, a 1st and a 3rd all this year and I'd trade Cutler.
p881
aV@KyleKorver 97-89 Bulls win!
p882
aV@Jones_Drew32 You sat the last 2 games when your team was still in the hunt for the playoffs. Keep your mouth shut.
p883
aV@ESPNChiBears Would WAS give you McNabb & a 1st for Cutler? I'd take it and draft a QB. Cutler is no longer the Bear's "QB of the future"
p884
aV@ESPNChiBears I smell a QB competition next training camp
p885
aV@DavidHaugh is it just me or is the normally reliable Maynard having a terrible game?
p886
aV@KyleKorver 96-91 Bulls win
p887
aV@WaddleandSilvy Say you traded Taj for Mayo, how many minutes could you really have given to Scalabrine today?
p888
aV@SamSmithHoops Mayo seems to be auditioning for his trade to the Bulls, he's creeping the Grizz back into this game
p889
aV@sportsguy33 you're a moron for picking the seashawks. Last week was their super bowl. They simply aren't any good away from home.
p890
aV@Chris_Broussard why is Randolph still worth a 1st rounder? Doesn't seem like he's ever done anything to warrant it
p891
aV@Chris_Broussard Why aren't the Bulls looking at him harder? Wouldn't he be perfect there?
p892
aV@CarmenDeFalco Be sure to ask Harry tomorrow if the Bulls won by enough for him
p893
aV@AdamSchefter Classy job by you. I admire that.
p894
aV@sportsguy33 best team in the NFC is...?
p895
aV@sportsguy33 secretariat and that thing with common and queen latifa
p896
aV@sportsguy33 that's insulting to tarvaris
p897
aVRT @BoriClass: @WaddleandSilvy this is the OFFICIAL take Bogans off starting 5 TWEET/... Retweet if u agree...lol
p898
aV@MatthewBerryTMR PANDA WATCH: Comprised of only former champs of other leagues. Auction, FAAB, No Ks. Active emailing, blogs, and messages
p899
aVRose deserves more credit than this as a future all star starter "@KCJHoop: DRose 28 FGAs. 0 FTAs."
p900
aVSuch BS KCJHoop: DRose 28 FGAs. 0 FTAs.
p901
aV@mortreport is Felix Jones playing today?
p902
aV@sportsguy33 LAW OF GUS!!
p903
aV@MatthewBerryTMR Nate washington or Sid Rice??
p904
aVBig win by the @chicagobulls tonight! Clutch plays down the stretch, huge night by Taj. This ain't your daddy's circus trip!
p905
aV@WaddleandSilvy I'll take Bennett
p906
aVRT @ESPNChicago: FOLLOW & RT for your chance to win 4 tickets to the 5th annual Chicago Invitational Challenge! http://es.pn/chiinvitational
p907
aV@HousefromDC If salary wasn't an issue,  absolutely agree, he'd be perfect bench scorer for them. But can't take on that deal for a 6th man
p908
aV@MatthewBerryTMR So I guess Randy Moss will have a bye week after all
p909
aV@WaddleandSilvy Bulls, MNF, Hawks, Series
p910
aV@sportsguy33 moss nobody
p911
aV@hoopshype what first round pick? They gave em all to cleveland and toronto
p912
aV@KCJHoop Were they ever interested in trading for Bayless? Fernandez still possible?
p913
aV@sportsguy33 even with 3 SD timeouts? First down wouldn't have put the game away, only make SD use up timeouts
p914
aV@MatthewBerryTMR no condolences for bears fans who were jobbed on the cutler goalline fumble??
p915
aV@sportsguy33 Are you trying to reverse jinx the Yanks? It seems to be working
p916
aV@sportsguy33 make that a walkoff 7-run HR
p917
aV@ZachZaidman More like Tuck, Osi and the Seattle secondary. Wake up Zach, this line can't protect the passer or get a ground game going
p918
aV@sportsguy33 that's Nolan Ryan?? He looks like Sloth from Goonies
p919
aVExcept of course for the divisional round and conf championship @ZachZaidman: only time they'll play 2 straight weeks at home all season

aVWow that was lame @sportsguy33: Everybody Pat Chung tonight!
p922
aVSuper Bears! Super Bowl!
p923
aVDEVIN HESTER YOU ARE RIDICULOUS!!!
p924
aV@dougthonus Yeah, why the f--- won't they give up Noah for Melo??
p925
aV@ESPNChiBulls Maybe not this year, but you need superstars to compete for titles. Noah is a great role player, but no superstar.
p926
aV@MatthewBerryTMR Hasn't been on the field all game
p927
aV@ZachZaidman where's aromashodu?
p928
aV@MatthewBerryTMR Is he worth using up #1 waiver position?
p929
aV@sportsguy33 Really? Still bitter? Get over it. You've had 6 titles in 10 years
p930
aV@DavidHaugh If the Bears lose, is it a fireable offense to not have taken the lead with the defense playing the way it is?
p931
aV@skoreit has the best deals on the internet!
p932
aV@WaddleandSilvy Chris Broussard
p933
aV@WaddleandSilvy Go Forte, guys like Crabtree, Maclin and MSW should still be around in the 5th.
p934
aV@WaddleandSilvy You mean we didn't trade for 2005 Chris Harris?
p935
aV@MatthewBerryTMR Davone Bess get more targets?

p938
aV@sportsguy33 Does any team besides NYK try a trade for Melo? Risky if he wants to play in NY bad enough to leave 65M on the table for now
p939
aV@sportsguy33 are you sure its not, "Can I smoosh you, please?"
p940
aV@sportsguy33 what the hell is with the bunny massacre story??
p941
aV@hoopshype Tracy McGrady was the best free agent left? Yeeesh.
p942
aV@hoopshype Like it...Signed, Bulls Fans
p943
aV@dougthonus Can Luther Head give you any minutes as a PG? His min offer got rescinded by NO.
p944
aV@chadfordinsider Will mgmt come around or will Henry become available for trade?
p945
aV@dougthonus Like Redick, still need a def wing. Go get Brewer and we're 9 deep with well-fitting role players around DRose
p946
aV@chadfordinsider So why not sign in CHI with ready made roster? I call BS
p947
aV@KCJHoop Sources: LeBron will make is FA announcement from the Moon.
p948
aV@RicBucher Then say its about money when you're asked. Don't say its about winning, when you're out there looking for every last dollar
p949
aV@ESPNChiBulls You're too hard on Deng's deal, bad but FA mkt is proving its fair. Worse ways to spend, you gave 2, Gay and JJ will be as bad
p950
aV@chadfordinsider Unless CLE is taking back bad TOR contracts (Hedo), why is Varajeo, West, Hix, better than Gibson, picks, trade exception?
p951
aV@sportsguy33 Not even for a better shot at custody of his Chicago based kids?
p952
aV@RicBucher MIA/NY have no players, if Wade and others are truly about winning, sign in CHI and prove it. Money will follow championships.
p953
aVRT @sportsguy33: A source tells me Gregg Popovich and RC Buford have finally stopped hugging after hearing about Richard Jefferson's opt ...
p954
aVRT @STEIN_LINE_HQ: LeBron's last two scheduled sitdowns, for now, are with his assumed top two -- Bulls and hometown Cavs -- after Heat  ...
p955
aV@chadfordinsider Bulls have what's it gonna take to get jefferson?
p956
aV@sportsguy33 Valiant? What happened to America being better at stuff and expecting to win? The olympic basketball team wouldn't accept it
p957
aV@KCJHoop Would Bulls sell 17 pick? Or only deal it to move Hinirch or Deng?
p958
aV@sportsguy33 I'm wary, last time Cannes had a film about an Escobar, Vinnie Chase's career nearly ended.
p959
aV@sportsguy33 Bulls say no: Bosh can walk to MIA in the summer or they can sign him outright in 8 months. A year ago sure, not now.
p960
aV@TheRealTMR Trade Help! PPR&6pts per TDpass - Rodgers and Pierre T for Warner and Benson.  Warners got a solid postseans schedule.
p961
aV@sportsguy33 Bigger first round fantasy disappointment - EV or LDT?
