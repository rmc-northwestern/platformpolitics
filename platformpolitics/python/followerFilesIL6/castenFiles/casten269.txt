aV@swearyG @Nick_argall @taytay_88_ hard to call it an eclipse when it's a dot wandering across the sun
p1591
aV@swearyG @Nick_argall @taytay_88_ yeah. Venus "ecplised" earth twice in the last 10 years, i.e. It was directly between us and the sun
p1592
aV@swearyG and i'd say it's high time you answered some questions. I'll stick with "are all the planets flat?"
p1593
aV@swearyG @Nick_argall @taytay_88_ basic geo- and trigonometry will get you there
p1594
aV@swearyG @Nick_argall @taytay_88_ 11 degrees (=arctan(1 AU /5.2 AU)). Jupiter would still be &gt;90% illuminated
p1595
aV@swearyG @Nick_argall @taytay_88_ nope. Looking from the sun it'd be dead on illuminated, correct? Well, earth's view is shifted by...
p1596
aV@swearyG where on jupiter's orbit would it not look illuminated from earth? https://t.co/yYU9hTGfeu
p1597
aV@swearyG qualitatively is good enough. Doesn't need to be to scale. It's easy to do for the moon https://t.co/DHEcgnQaHY
p1598
aV@swearyG from our vantage point, jupiter would always be illuminated. I challenge you to sketch me a scenario where it wouldn't be
p1599
aV@swearyG again: it's not like the they're always exactly the illuminated the same way. The edges do move minorly around, and aren't circular
p1600
aV@swearyG nope. If you have a triangle, and you lengthen one side, the angle doesn't stay the same. Same principle here
p1601
aV@swearyG what do you mean? For phases to appear, it needs to pass between earth and the sun (from our vantage point)
p1602
aV@swearyG think of the position the moon needs to be in to appear crescent, or "empty". Mars can't be between earth and the sun
p1603
aV@swearyG but nowhere near the ones we see on the moon or venus. Of course earth would have phases if viewed from jupiter or mars or pluto
p1604
aV@swearyG but only in the range of arcminutes, if at all (think: not perfectly elliptical)
p1605
aV@swearyG cause they need to pass between earth and the sun. Simple geometry. There might be really minor "phases" visible on outer bodies...
p1606
aV@swearyG @TakeThatEarth i still want you to answer if the other planets are also flat. And if they actually exist.
p1607
aV@swearyG @TakeThatEarth oh, it's clearly both, as you choose to harp on that point, as if you didn't know what i mean. Just deflection
p1608
aV@swearyG @TakeThatEarth granted, not the most rigorous phrasing of mine, but clearly just trying to twist my words
p1609
aV@swearyG curious: are the other planets also flat? Do they even exist?

aV@MurphyBruno the ball going over odor's head allows pillar to score either way (and goins to move up)
p1920
aV@MurphyBruno ... Think that an infielder would drop that on purpose. As a baserunnner, it doesn't make a difference what the ump calls
p1921
aV@MurphyBruno well, i assume that the ball in play would have played out the same, regardless if IF fly called or not. There's no reason to..
p1922
aV@MurphyBruno if it's caught, they can tag up and try to advance. If it's dropped, any player can advance at his own risk
p1923
aV@MurphyBruno nah, a called infield fly is a live ball. All it means is that the batter-runner is out, and no one is forced to move on
