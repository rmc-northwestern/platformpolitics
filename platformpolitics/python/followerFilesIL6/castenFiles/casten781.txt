p2304
aVImportant question: does anyone know what "this has been a post" means? I often see it after a post was posted that was obviously a post.
p2305
aV@GOPofToday a symptom of my disability is that I am rarely able to get bored. You are boring me despite my impairment. Congratulations!
p2306
aV@GOPofToday yes, I do have a disability. Does that make you feel superior? I'm sure your mother is very proud.
p2307
aV@GOPofToday there you go. Finally you are honest. Now you can go home.
p2308
aV@GOPofToday are you bragging about corrupt police who kill white people too? It is lucky for police you are not in charge of their PR!
p2309
aV@GOPofToday it is actually not witty to use insults made of ableist slurs. I do have a developmental disability. And you have ignorance.

aV@GOPofToday he didn't call me, but now that he is dead it looks like running was a very logical choice indeed.

aV@GOPofToday because he is Black. Really. Google is your friend.

aV@GOPofToday or because he was afraid he might die in custody. Did he call you and tell you why he ran?
p2316
aV@GOPofToday it is complicated and systematic. I think you should Google it. Twitter is too brief to say much.
p2317
aV@Edwardsthegreat Chicago has problems and therefore it is "hypocrisy" to see problems anywhere else? Unfortunate logic for today's world.
p2318
aV@GOPofToday false arrest and false imprisonment due to racial profiling are wrong. Killing people "accidentally" when abusing them is wrong.
p2319
aV@GOPofToday I think you are confusing noticing something with creating it. It was a racial issue long before I was even born.
p2320
aV@VanityByNature thank you!! The trolls lol: Apparently more injustice shows that injustice is just, and saying murder is wrong=killing cops.
p2321
aV@Edwardsthegreat are you trying to show that the system is not corrupt by citing more corruption? Interesting logic.
p2322
aV@GOPofToday I'm not sure where injustice comes from. That doesn't make it just.

p2933
aV@AuerbachKeller do you have a list of who is involved that you tried to contact? If I'm connected with any of them, maybe I can get answers
p2934
aV@AuerbachKeller I should look into that. If people are forcing, they are doing bad action, not best practice at all. They should be stopped
p2935
aV@AuerbachKeller also "direct instruction" (scripted behavioral training) and ABA should not be forced- nor high-stakes testing.
p2936
aV@AuerbachKeller that is actually very important. I agree with you. Nothing should ever be forced on students. Is this happening?
p2937
aV@AuerbachKeller Many others use minimal support or none now. Their testimony is what got me to see it is sure not harmful to hear them.
p2938
aV@AuerbachKeller also wish you'd interviewed Hope Block and quoted Pamela Block more precisely, with less error.
p2939
aV@AuerbachKeller I think it was a mistake in your article to rest so much on believing a known fraud who was caught. Of course she deflects.
p2940
aV@AuerbachKeller I have a friend for whom FC was useless, who now thrives with RPM. It really does matter who the person is, what they need.
p2941
aV@AuerbachKeller such as high-stakes testing and one-size-fits-all curricular thinking.
p2942
aV@AuerbachKeller medical EBP looks at the patient, also anecdotes &amp; case histories. If educators understood that, many ills would be fixed.
p2943
aV@AuerbachKeller yes. He is an educator rather than a medical doctor, so I believe he's using it in the narrow, less useful way I described.
p2944
aV@AuerbachKeller we still allow people to go to talk therapists &amp; use sign language - not true that one bad apple spoils all: remove bad ones
p2945
aV@AuerbachKeller or the fact that also in the 90s, regular talk therapists were reporting extra unreal memories in the satanic ritual fad.
p2946
aV@AuerbachKeller and I sure don't believe frauds are able to cause a think never to work. Think of the sign language debacle in South Africa
p2947
aV@AuerbachKeller it is harmful when wrongdoers pervert practices, but I'm not sure I believe them when they say their fraud was "unwitting"
p2948
aV@AuerbachKeller I can tell you about my position and how I came to it. Preview: https://t.co/q65JzrNWyk
p2949
aV@AuerbachKeller it is as if educators are trying to test math skills with spelling tests: just doesn't fit. Medical tests are medical.
p2950
aV@AuerbachKeller 2/2 and justify silencing and depriving people who benefit from teaching that does not fit the drug protocol paradigm.
p2951
aV@AuerbachKeller by designing quasi-experiments and defining "what works" in particular ways, educators can show that abuse "works" 1/2 (ABA)
p2952
aV@AuerbachKeller ..2/2 idea was detrimentally oversimplified. What EBP means in my field is thus narrow and not very useful.
p2953
