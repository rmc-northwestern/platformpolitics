p2613
aV@KevinRussell77 in fact, doesn't all good art help us think about those issues?

aV@KevinRussell77 but aren't Nolan's Batman movies so popular because they deal with those bigger, eternal issues like justice and morality?

aV@jrgordon13 @jlmerck Curse you British TV!!!!
p2630
aV@strachanjm @jrgordon13 And that may just be a particularity to me. But what you love about it is probably why I find it so\u2026meh
p2631
aV@strachanjm @jrgordon13 As someone in that position - and who thinks a lot about that tension - I don't think the show does it that well
p2632
aV@strachanjm @jrgordon13 I don't think it is a *bad* show. I just don't see what y'all see. Also - the wife is an underdeveloped character.
p2633
aV@strachanjm @jrgordon13 It turns out I didn't actually have a second part to this two part tweet (2/2)
p2634
aV@strachanjm @jrgordon13 I am not wild about TV shows that portray reasonable clergy as the ones that blanket affirm homosexuality (1/2)
p2635
aV@strachanjm @jrgordon13 But I found the plots of the first 5 episodes to be\u2026meh. (2/2)
p2636
aV@strachanjm @jrgordon13 I find authentic characters interesting if they are put in interesting circumstances (1/2)
p2637
aV@jrgordon13 Maybe I wouldn't be bothered by those issues as much if it were a show about a shoemaker
p2638
aV@jrgordon13 The "Behind the curtain" aspect is interesting - but my weirdness re:theological issues is amplified by his calling
p2639
aV@jrgordon13 But that could just be why *I* don't like it - maybe not a good critique of the show
p2640
aV@jrgordon13 Homosexuality and interfaith dialogue - and I think I bristle because the character is clergy.
p2641
aV@jrgordon13 It seems like something I *should* like - I might be overly sensitive to its handling of theological questions
p2642
aV@jrgordon13 His character is pretty good - but I rarely laugh and don't find the episodes that interesting. Other than the bible quiz in ep1
p2643
aV@jrgordon13 see - I don't even get why you would say that. Not sure how low/high church factors in....
p2644
aV@jrgordon13 @strachanjm I am clearly not seeing what you guys are seeing - why do y'all love so much? I would give it a resounding 'meh'

aV@dorelm haven't used any music syncing (thanks to @spotify); the photo stream has been kinda nice. I don't take that many photos, though.
p2862
aV@dorelm I don't know how to respond to #2, but I recommend Dropbox, and adding iCloud if you want to use Pages/Keynote etc. on your iPad
p2863
aV@strachanjm It isn't mac that is the root of all kinds of evil, it is the *love* of mac that is the root of all kinds of evil.
p2864
aV@strachanjm I continue to pray for that
p2865
aV@strachanjm I use other, cross platform, less proprietary services. Not useless, but I would say inferior unless you are 100% apple.
p2866
aV@strachanjm I'm glad you are getting good use out of it - but iCloud has next to zero benefits for my life/work.
p2867
aV@strachanjm So, it seems like iCloud only is useful if you produce things via Apple apps on iOS devices.
p2868
aV@strachanjm Did MobileMe offer you the same ability? Did it have any iOS functionality?
p2869
aV@strachanjm when it comes to where I store my documents on the cloud, I don't plan on using two services - I'll use dropbox
p2870
aV@strachanjm well, since Burger King makes whoppers, and McDonald's makes Big Macs, they must not be in competition :)
p2871
aV@strachanjm You mean, the two services that offer the same thing? Seems like the definition of competition to me....

aV@crridenour I recently started playing RBI baseball again. Best game ever
p3066
aV@crridenour ah yes. Now I remember - more pages to write than hours left in the semester. Though, NCAA football was fun....
p3067
aV@victorsaad a double check for tomorrow - how are you with big friendly dogs?
p3068
aV@crridenour you mean when you played NCAA football instead of writing papers?

aV@jrgordon13 I didn't realize Analytical theologians had hearts - I thought their chests held an extra processor for working out algorithms
p3076
aV@strachanjm she didn't mind too much - although she did attempt to sleep through it. She felt that he was meandering
p3077
aV@strachanjm I am not well versed enough in Philosophy to really enter that dialogue. Also I don't care about the topic as it is expressed
p3078
aV@strachanjm it isn't about God/man, but YHWH/Israel. (Listened to some NTW theology conference on the way in).

aV@jrgordon13 Thanks for the Bon Iver RT - I've been waiting to buy that CD for a month now, waiting for Amazon to make it cheap
p3087
aV@jrgordon13 If I understand it right - no time limit, just ads
p3088
aV@jrgordon13 agreed - are you paying for it or going free?
p3089
aV@jrgordon13 gnight
p3090
aV@jrgordon13 but they all affirm "real presence" in some manner. None of them affirm a strictly metaphorical understanding.
p3091
aV@jrgordon13 39 articles are not the definitive guide to Anglican theology. Our eucharistic prayers seem (to me) incompatible with zwingli.
p3092
aV@gjackson wouldn't you rather stay up and talk about the eucharist with us? #forthekingdom
p3093
aV@jrgordon13 that Jesus is really there? Because then you are really disagree with Jesus and Paul :)
p3094
aV@jrgordon13 you just made me think of this: http://t.co/rEQoG9f
p3095
aV@jrgordon13 I wouldnt leave the "what" to mystery, but I might leave the "how"\u000a to mystery. Hooker argues that Jesus is there, don't ask how
p3096
aV@jrgordon13 not arbitrary - sacraments are intersections b/w heaven and earth. I think that makes it the best time to pull the mystery card.
p3097
aV@jrgordon13 because how could it be that God does things that we can't describe or meticulously analyze? &lt;/sarcasm&gt;

p3114
aV@funguyom Nicaea wasn't mob rule - nor was Chalcedon. Anglicans have never been in the business of "re-imagining" orthodoxy...
p3115
aV@funguyom Anglican unity is found in common worship, but you can't just use the Book of Common Prayer and call yourself an Anglican
p3116
aV@funguyom also, 39 articles are not Trent or the Westminster Catechism, and saying Anglicanism is founded on divorce is a red herring
p3117
aV@funguyom ...is  believed to be inconsistent with Christian living by most of the global church, you aren't exactly being a "Good Anglican."

p3119
aV@strachanjm Looking at the film's website, I am already annoyed. I will give it a watch, perhaps it will spawn an interesting blog post....
p3120
aV@funguyom I will take the bait - if by "good Anglican" you mean "in communion with most global and historic Anglicans," then no, you can't.

p3148
aV@strachanjm agreed
p3149
aV@trsavage I enjoyed the article you shared on google reader today - best point: he isn't even the best player on his own team!
p3150
aV@trsavage it absolutely is. LeBron can't win this year - not after his departure from CLE. He needs to wait a few years to get humble.

aV@jrgordon13 thanks - I was pretty proud of it
