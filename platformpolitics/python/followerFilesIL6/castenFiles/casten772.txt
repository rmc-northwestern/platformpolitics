aV@MattBowen41 Regardless, great season from the Hawks and especially GBW, now it's the Bears turn. Bear down!
p26
aV@MattBowen41 Close game that could've gone either way it seemed, but it also seems we're always on the outside looking in.
p27
aV@MattBowen41 I hear ya, but I think you'd see the same result against any of the teams ranked ahead of them. Just not enough offensive power
p28
aV@MattBowen41 Love the team. Had fun watching the season, but still disappointed we can't get over that hump, that's all.
p29
aV@MattBowen41 Likely 3rd highest ranked big ten team, and the fiesta bowl against Houston? Doesn't seem big time to me.

aV@MattBowen41 Most likely 3rd highest ranked big ten team, and the fiesta bowl against Houston? Doesn't seem big time to me.
