aV@AnastasiaRGrey2 @CTGrey_CEO01 Oh well you didn't know anyone was photographing those bathing suit moments.
p2930
aV@AnastasiaRGrey2 @CTGrey_CEO01 Did he pose for that?

aV@AnastasiaRGrey2 @CTGrey_CEO01 \U0001f602
p2947
aV@AnastasiaRGrey2 @CTGrey_CEO01 But he should know so he can kick some ass
p2948
aV@CTGrey_CEO01 @AnastasiaRGrey2 It's not @AnastasiaRGrey2's fault that some Pervy paparazzi went after her
p2949
aV@AnastasiaRGrey2 @CTGrey_CEO01 At least he can find out now which photographer to kill
p2950
aV@AnastasiaRGrey2 @CTGrey_CEO01 I didn't want to post those out of respect for your family
p2951
aV@CTGrey_CEO01 @AnastasiaRGrey2 It was kinda pornish of them. Is that even a word?
p2952
aV@AnastasiaRGrey2 @CTGrey_CEO01 The ones of u on all fours were bad. Someone didnt need to zoom their camera lens like that on you

aV@CTGrey_CEO01 @AnastasiaRGrey2 Maybe I should tell him @AnastasiaRGrey2 don't want him to get worked up but he will be either way
p2956
aV@CTGrey_CEO01 @AnastasiaRGrey2 Ummm maybe I should focus on your recovery first and I should stay out of this
p2957
aV@AnastasiaRGrey2 @CTGrey_CEO01 Oh ok \U0001f44c\U0001f3fb Think I was reading that while I was working. Missed some of the details
p2958
aV@CTGrey_CEO01 @AnastasiaRGrey2 Oh good. He still doesnt know about those pictures that came out then.
p2959
aV@CTGrey_CEO01 @AnastasiaRGrey2  WTF I thought he was just stabbed! How the hell did he get a head injury?!
p2960
aV@AnastasiaRGrey2 @KatieHaigh2 @pll102098 @Mia_Grey1 @CTGrey_CEO01 @KatherineAGrey1 @GreyHouseKeeper \U0001f618 xoxo
p2961
aV@AnastasiaRGrey2 That's another lawsuit @CTGrey_CEO01 should look into when he's up to it. Nows probably not the best time.
p2962
aV@AnastasiaRGrey2 His instagram is soo annoying. I thought his Facebook was bad enough.

p2967
aV@AnastasiaRGrey2 @CTGrey_CEO01 I wouldn't want to be that photographer when he finds him
p2968
aV@AnastasiaRGrey2 @CTGrey_CEO01 Christian can't be mad at u though. Not your fault that whoever took those was a perv.

aV@AnastasiaRGrey2 @CTGrey_CEO01 Bet some walls will be punched and dishes broken
p2971
aV@AnastasiaRGrey2 @CTGrey_CEO01 Or get Barney to wipe em off the internet
p2972
aV@AnastasiaRGrey2 @CTGrey_CEO01 @CTGrey_CEO01 should sue
p2973
aV@AnastasiaRGrey2 @CTGrey_CEO01 Total violation of privacy
p2974
aV@AnastasiaRGrey2 @CTGrey_CEO01 I think so... some of those were so unnecessary
p2975
aV@AnastasiaRGrey2 @CTGrey_CEO01 I guess being followed by photographers is all part of being #MrsGrey
p2976
aV@AnastasiaRGrey2 @CTGrey_CEO01 Yeah he's gonna go postal. #KickSomePapsAss
