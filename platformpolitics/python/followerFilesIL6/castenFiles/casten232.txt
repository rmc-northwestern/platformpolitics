p42
aV@kikuzLoL Praise GvG and its RNG
p43
aV@kikuzLoL I Made one sky golem, gotta pit lord from it, immediately crafted the other XD
p44
aV@kikuzLoL tho if u don't care about winning just make grove keeper and 1 ToL and go mill, troll but fun
p45
aV@kikuzLoL I was thinking a less combo oriented hybrid focusing more on midrange minions with setup for Roar, like sky golem
p46
aV@kikuzLoL midrange is super easy to substitute too, long as u have dr balanced
p47
aV@kikuzLoL if u want a midrange u don't need to many either but there's a lot of class specific cards so idk
p48
aV@kikuzLoL Malorne isn't needed either, it's actually pretty bad cuz ur gonna want ur opponent fatiguing, not you.
p49
aV@kikuzLoL if you have mill Mage already Druid shouldn't be too expensive, you only need one ToL if one at all

aV@MrLemondog Not at all, but it's easy to point out bad rankings during the season when they were made before , not sure why they did it tho.
p73
aV@MrLemondog Those were based on the Pre-season tbf, notice how relatively low CJ and GE are compared to how they performed in OGN.

p117
aV@RiotKatana Go with an early Spectral Wraith followed by sorcs and guise for mpen for early game, then just full tank for the late game.
p118
aV@lolesports Gotta go with TSM. They handled the high pressure games vs DIG much better than their opponents, and came out on top for it #LCS
p119
aV@LoLDyrus Is that what happened today? That would explain a lot XD Kappa
p120
aV@Dadyrus @Thooorin TSM can go to worlds if they lose to LMQ next week tho, they can still win the 3rd place match.

p126
aVHey Double and Sneaky, what do you think about the recent rule changes to Twitch? #CTCS2
p127
aVHey Double and Sneaky, how big is the benefit of duoing with someone on your team as opposed to soloque? #CTCS2

aVDo you think that Lucian will be a pick/ban in playoffs? #CTCS2
p129
aV@BrokenshardEUW ONLY ADC!
p130
aV@lolesports Seeing Ackerman bully around the best laners in NA with Gragas made me main the champ instantly.
p131
aV@Locodoco Perhaps just add it to jungle items?
p132
aV@GregSkyWilliams Travis made a video about it, I'd check his twitter feed for his reporting.

aV@lolesports @ZionSpartan always answers stream questions very well and very often, giving a way to ask a pro player for advice any time #LCS

aV@lolesports To Zionspartan, what's the biggest difference between a successful and unsuccessful team environment #LCS
p136
aV@TSMGleeb_ Reported for unsportsmanlike behavior.

aV@lolesports Definitely @MrRallez . Sometimes he looks like one of the best EU has to offer, other times he is simply carried #LCS
p138
aV@Shiphtur ARAM with fans
p139
aV@GregSkyWilliams The use of the mute button?
p140
aV@RiotFeralPony An item allowing mana stealing (RIP old kassadin)

aV@Locodoco It's a comp that they haven't played in LCS much, with both Turtle and Bjerg's performance I trust it'll work very well next time.

p149
aV@YT_Zabo56 @TSMGleeb_ I know, I'm saying that just because you have vision doesn't mean you're paying attention, making timers a handicap
p150
aV@YT_Zabo56 @TSMGleeb_ Exactly, so if you just walked by without noticing you'd have the timer
p151
aV@TSMGleeb_ Currently, don't you not have to actually click the timer, but rather it starts automatically as long as you have vision?
p152
aV@TSMGleeb_ While I mostly agree with you, what do you think about someone getting vision but not knowing and still getting the timer?
p153

p171
aV@TSM_Amazing @BossPanda1 A kid overreacted to his joke, I overreacted to his overreaction. Mb.
p172
aV@BossPanda1 @TSM_Amazing Gratz on the bandwagoning, but you seem to be far to sensitive about a team doing poorly, I suggest growing up.
p173
aV@BossPanda1 @TSM_Amazing The salt with curse fans is real.
p174
aV@BossPanda1 @TSM_Amazing Curse "situation"?A team is doing poorly, its not a national tragedy. The shoutcasters made fun of the item choice.
p175
aV@BossPanda1 @TSM_Amazing Insensitive? He made fun of a bad item choice, not the death of their parents.
p176
aV@BossPanda1 @TSM_Amazing Because it's funny, and most people aren't so PJSalt
p177
aV@Locodoco Literally the second you said that, they did it and it worked PERFECTLY
p178
aV@TabzzLoL You carried that game so hard, ADC frontline OP! Still the best botlane in Europe, have full confidence you'll finish 1st.
p179
aV@GarveyNYC @Dadyrus To be fair though, SK had Kayle, Yorrik and Ashe to match those picks, which are extremely good late.
p180
aV@dverra @ggCMonteCristo @LustboyLOL did an AMA saying he had plans with a western team, and regi just tweeted that someone new is joining.

p184
aV@TabzzLoL I personally love when streamers answer questions, and have gotten tons of info from people like Gleeb and Zion who do this.
p185
aV@lolesports If @CurseGaming beats @compLexityLive , this will be the second week in a row that every team goes 1-1 #LCS

aV@RiotKobe @LMQXiaoWeiXiao Dat BM joke #lcs
p188
aV@NintendudeX The tweet fits the prof pic perfectly
p189
aV@RiotQuickshot I feel like teams weren't given enough time to adapt, the only unique pick out of all the new options was an Ashe that failed
p190
aV@RiotQuickshot Millenium/Blitzcrank. They both rely 100% on picks
p191
aV@RiotDeficio Not to great on ADC but amazing on Jayce and Nasus. I like that people are innovating beyond the intended purpose of the item.

p201
aV@VoyboyLoL you're going to turn it around vs the two best teams? Lol wut?
p202
aV@NintendudeX Coast level calls.
p203
aV@RiotPhreak Lucian, cuz double time
p204
aV@lolesports TSM. They had a roster change as big as DIG, but with Gleeb having no LCS experience, they have huge potential to improve #LCS
p205
aV@Fnatic_sOAZ I know you used PJSalt as a joke in your last tweet, but for real, even you probably know this isn't how you stop a slump.
p206
aV@snoopeh ww. ?
p207
aV@RiotQuickshot @TabzzLoL Guess you could blame the players for their failing career and management for the failing team.
p208
aV@Wilkuz @RiotQuickshot @TabzzLoL Look at ocelote, who talked with riot management after his issues and had a HUGE attitude improvement.
p209
aV@TabzzLoL I think @RiotQuickshot is saying they're responsible but you're saying a smart manager would reign them in. Both seem to be right.
p210
aVI think quickshot is saying they're responsible for their actions, but that any smart manager would have reigned them
p211
aV@RiotJatt @C9Sneaky You dealt more magic damage on Corki than @VoyboyLoL dealt on Oriana.

aVI like @Shiphtur, but when you're on my enemy's fantasy draft and I'm already down 30 points, I can't exuse that kind of game. Shame on you.
p217
aV@lolesports every game this week has been an upset, so I predict the REAL upset will be a win for SK!
p218
aV@adrianwashere33 Followed cuz profile pic.

aV@HeartbeatLoL Feel ya bro. Just look in a lost and found or some shit, there's probably some dirty (but usable) ones there.
p220
aV@Fnatic_sOAZ @Yakghanistan Yeah, prove your the best in EUROPE on an INTERNATIONAL stage. Trolls make soooo much sense.
p221
aV@SkumbagKrepo The rematch of my 2 favorite teams, OMG and c9!
p222
aV@FNATIC @FnaticxPeke Definitely  not first blood...
p223
aV@dscarra True, but to be fair, if you are from Korea, NA or EU and you watch Brazilian challenger series, you at least deserve a metal.
p224
aV@XDG_Benny The worst thing you can wish on your enemies is a comcast monopoly in their area.

p229
aV@SamSung_Heart Biggest fan bro, keep up the good work #worlds
p230
aV@CrsDominate It's funny because if Curse was held to the standard of other regions, they would be relegated instantly.
p231
aV@CrsDominate That's because EU countries don't offer VISA's for LoL players, as they don't recognize it as a sport.
p232
aV@CrsDominate It's not about heritage. It's about who you choose to represent and fight for. @LMQtcVasilii even said he would chant USA
p233
aV@TSMReginald @TSMTheOddOne A team decision to bench someone temporarily is one thing,but with oddone retiring, i cant help but stack tear :(
p234
aV@TSM_Amazing Gotta feel bad for CW doe... imagine what they would be if TSM didn't steal you and @Bjergsen
p235
aV@Joe_Miller It has to be C9 and TSM. Constantly the best, both in fans and performance.
p236
aVRT @ggCMonteCristo: No real positive roster changes for EU yet, while NA gets a ton. I'm a bit worried about the general strength of EU tea\u2026
p237
aV@ZionSpartan CLG adding Seraph, Dig adding Zion + Shiphtur, TSM adding Glu, And CLB and LMQ joining? Summer 2014 LCS is gonna be intense!
