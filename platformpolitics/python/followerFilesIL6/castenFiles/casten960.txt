p10
aV@Cianaf Have you watched Ron Parker? Seems to be popular these days. How is his play?
p11
aV@adamjahns at 6'3, 300 LBS would he make a good 3-4 DE?

aV@evansilva What can he do to change his designation from TE to WR moving on? Petition NFL? Has it been done before?
p32
aV@nfldraftscout I don't see any teams judging Packers, it's just media guys/fans doing that. Teams just passed on signing him.

aV@djdurkin Isn't it surprising he signed for minimum? I thought he'd get a nice pay bump from somebody.
p39
aV@djdurkin Good to know, looking forward to listening.
p40
aV@djdurkin Sure did. Great job on the safeties. You guys should do one on DTs, too.
p41
aV@djdurkin Thanks.Ever though about doing regular draft/Bears podcast? Your hits on the Score are great, but 5-10 minutes is not enough.
p42
aV@BearReport What happened to @djdurkin doing some work on Bear Report? He announced it a while ago. He'd be a good guy to do podcast with.

p73
aV@EAMaddenNFL Looks good. How about some gameplay videos? Not much out there.
p74
aV@kfishbain Seems like Hester a better option)) Impressing throw by him.
p75
aV@SoldierFieldBlg officials handed the ball to Washington. No hold calls on numerous plays.
p76
aV@seankjensen why #31 not suspended numerous times is beyond me.
p77
aV@EAMaddenNFL nice, but the sim posted on ESPN yesterday was awful looking. Which is the real next-gen?
p78
aV@dan_bernstein otherwise known as Thursday football
p79
aV@djdurkin You get pushed around by tight ends so no wonder.
p80
aV@Edwerderespn Trade to Tampa Bay also a possibility?
p81
aV@djdurkin Do they have data how long he holds the ball before the throw? avg this year vs last.
p82
aV@mikecwright Turnovers definitely on Culter, but the fact that he did bring them close seems encouraging after early struggles.
p83
aV@4for4_Josh You really think guy that's one incident away from yearlong suspension is a good fit for Lions?

aV@adamspeaks Any HC with 4 wins?
p88
aV@djdurkin Don't count out Ponder running it in now))
p89
aV@MarkPotash Would you say resigning Kellen Davis was more on Lovie or Emery? Seems like a big miss considering M. Bennett was available.
p90
aV@adamspeaks Shame. Talented guy but they will probably end up releasing him.
p91
aV@adamspeaks Thanks. How does he compare to Webb's rating?

p112
aV@BradBiggs No wonder Bears passed. Lots of $ for guy fresh off ACL tear that might not be ready for the camp.
p113
aV@greggrosenthal Raiders are trying to force him into retirement, then boom, 2 1st round picks for him.
p114
aV@evansilva True. Wondering how much Lance Louis got, coming off ACL few months ago.
p115
aV@ESPNChiBears was he involved in the car accident?
p116
aV@BradBiggs Do you think 54 might reconsider after seeing what is out there?
p117
aV@adbrandt Didnt his contract from 12 rollover to 13 for spending entire year on PUP?
p118
aV@SC_DougFarrar He will be compensated by making it in after a terrible season.
p119
aV@BradBiggs what are your thoughts on Mike Tice and his future in Chicago?

aV@PFF_Loechner Fitz wasn't the best guess then.
p140

aV@Aaron_Nagler Morning fishing? AJ Jenkins is out of shape, Jeffery had cramps.
p153
aV@BearReport Great article on McClellin. Are you going to do one on Jeffery?
p154
aV@FantasyDouche There is randomness to the process, old &amp; young, teams try to limit randomness as much as they can. Easier w guy's history
p155
aV@FantasyDouche Agreed. 25 can be HC. Which one? How would you know which one of 5 000 000 25 yo would you choose with v little info on him?
p156
aV@FantasyDouche All those ppl created businesses. They didn't just get hired as managers. They worked hard/had revolutionary ideas.
p157
aV@FantasyDouche Zuckerberg created his co. You don't create NFL team. You buy it. Even from scratch it cost you $750 mil.
p158
aV@FantasyDouche There is a chance that 25 yo might be the greatest HC, but GM, who travelled that road, won't take the chance.
p159
aV@FantasyDouche there is a ladder you need to climb to become surgeon, judge, CEO of multibiliion company and HC in the NFL. That is the way
p160
aV@FantasyDouche  NFL teams are $800 mil companies, how come you don't see many 25 yo jeopardy contestants leading them?
p161
aV@FantasyDouche Managing people who don't respect you is the hardest thing ever. Especially when they make way more $ that you.
p162
aV@FantasyDouche Kyle Shanahan, McDaniels are like 25 yo jeopardy guys in football.  They have the knowledge and what else?
p163
aV@FantasyDouche I don't see the comparisons between knowledge based jeopardy and managing young, aggressive, defiant people being correct.
p164
aVhttp://t.co/hW25OO4r
p165
aV@evansilva What if you take out Newton rushing efforts?
p166
aV@BradBiggs Could he be useful to the Bears after 2 years out of football?
p167
aV@adamspeaks Don't you think if Bears really wanted to keep Okoye they would have matched what Bucs gave him?
p168
aV@adamspeaks Bucs investing heavily in DL since 09. Still way below average.
p169
aV@adamspeaks 28th in 2010, 32nd in 2009. Just bad even healthy.
p170
aV@adamspeaks Bucs 32nd vs run last year. DL not great despite high picks.
p171
aV@ESPNChiBears Any chance Bears resign Adams with Okoye gone?
p172
aV@BradBiggs Emery: We love our guys so much, we probably not even going to draft anybody. Anything else would be surprising coming from him.
p173
aV@ProFootbalFocus Shouldn't you only use guys who started all 16 games?
p174
aV@ChrisWesseling Before Marshall Henne was a superstar. Now?
p175
aV@SC_DougFarrar I don't think there are 2nd and 3rd round QBs anymore. QBs with any, even later rounds potential gets catapulted into 1st.
p176
aV@lionsinwinter then why the question? I don't think ESPN has the power to change the results of 2011 season.
p177
aV@lionsinwinter Still? When were Lions clear #2 to begin with?
p178
aV@seankjensen he is @iamdevinthomas
p179
aV@skjensen Who did the Vikings lose? Rice was a complete non factor for Seattle, Danieal Manning a quality starter.
p180
aV@BearReport Nothing for Danieal Manning? That is pretty surprising.
p181
aV@vxmcclure23 Nothing for Danieal Manning? He got nice pay from the Texans.
p182
aV@TomPelissero You want to see Bowman in coverage? Youtube Aaron Rodgers highlights 2011.
p183
aV@espn_nfcnblog Not nice but correct. Bowman looked completely out of place and got beat like a drum.
p184
aV@SigmundBloom Not the way to do business in NFL. Ross desperately trying to put himself in positive light.
p185
aV@mikecwright Combine all those guys contracts and Forte is sure to reject it if offered.
p186
aV@MikeKlis I don't think you can "prepare" a guy for being paralyzed with fear when on the field.
p187
aV@skjensen Anything left on the idea of David Hawthorne to the Bears?
p188
aV@skjensen Hopefully it's the last time we hear #2 speak.
p189
aV@SC_DougFarrar Everybody knows how Marshall is. Hurd's issues came out of nowhere.
p190
aV@PFF_NateJahnke tough to catch when whifing on a block.
p191
aV@nfldraftscout Can Weems play well outside the numbers?
p192
aV@MikeKlis 20-28 without Cutler, 12-20 without Culter, Marshall. Don't see them as an issue.
p193
aV@KCJoynerTFS You think Hester becomes better deep threat if not treated like #1 WR now?
p194
aV@BMarshall19 #15 or #19?
p195
aV@evansilva Can Redskins back out now?
p196
aV@skjensen I'd say its a new half of a team.
p197
aV@nfldraftscout Also, don't see Bears looking into Manning at all.
p198
aV@MarkPotash Was that Harper that hurt both Carimi and Bennett? I remember him standing over hurt 80, but not Carimi.
p199
aV@TheGamersLab Point of view. Camera should be lower and view should be broader.
p200
aV@MikeKlis Law & Order: SVU based on Cox story probably on its way.
p201
aV@evansilva Panthers are 9 mil over the cap. You think they would admit a mistake and cut Williams?
p202
aV@ESPNChiBears @ProFootballTalk
p203
aV@Donny_Moore @NFL 2007. Unless you call JaMarcus Russell and Brady Quin QBs.
p204
aV@caplannfl If ranking talent, ability where's Cutler? Arm like Stafford, runs much better.
p205
aV@OptimumScouting You think Earl Bennett can make it as an outside guy for the Bears?
p206
aV@yourboyroy All Martz needed to succeed was HOF QB, HOF LT, HOF RB, and multiple probowler WRs. Is that too much to ask for?
p207
aV@skjensen Sean, do Bears get a compensatory pick for Danieal Manning?
p208
aV@JoshNorris AP

aV@EBBennett80 GB
p211
aV@jasonjwilde C
p212
aV@skjensen And. There. Is. Your. Dagger.
p213
aV@PFF_MikeClay True, but wouldn't Cowboys give MB more opportunities considering Witten's age and # of receptions?
p214
aV@PFF_MikeClay There are lots of great athletes that can't play: special teams guy with last TD scored in 2008.
p215
aV@PFF_MikeClay Bennett has 800 rec yards since being picked in 08 + questionable work ethic. Where's the upside? Bears will go other way.
p216
aV@PFF_MikeClay Just because he'd be an ex-Cowboy not gonna happen. Shiancoe, Carlson more likely.
p217
aV@skjensen Best dream: Bears don't draft WR with high pick because they can't develop WRs. Sign established #1 like VJax or Bowe. Draft LT,CB
p218
aV@skjensen Just like Angelo. What is he doing these days? Why not bring him back.
p219
aV@skjensen how come no Saints guys on the GM search list? Great drafts. Great FA finds.
p220
aV@skjensen Hopefully a game like that will make Bears understand the value of #1 WR.
p221
aV@mikecwright I think It's not a bad idea. Wasn't Cutler in the similar situation in Denver? Shanny for passing game & smbdy else run game.
p222
aV@skjensen Can Ravens say no? Draft trade snafu or any other reason?
p223
aV@daverichard Olsen was 1st rounder. Not on the Bears roster.
p224
aV@PFF_MikeClay I think Bears will stay out of Cowboys retreats hoarding. Hurd, Barber & Williams were quite enough.
p225
aV@AdamHogeCBS drop for a pick indeed routine for Williams.
p226
aV@nfldraftscout What about J'marcus Webb?
p227
aV@JeffDarlington $2 mil to stop Orton from being back to the Hanie?
p228
aV@mikecwright Say Saints sign him, do Bears get anything in compensation?
p229
aV@BradBiggs Stafford's got 6 inches and 45 lbs on Moore. Yet, when Moore charged him, he curled up like a little girl.
p230
aV@WilliamsonNFL Wouldn't Packers just run then? They can do it pretty well.
p231
aV@BradBiggs Nick Cole still out there. He turned down few teams, but why not Chi?
p232
aV@EBBennett80 Set up PayPal account and rock on!!!
p233
aV@ProFootbalFocus how is Jamarcus Webb doing this year?
p234
aV@skjensen I thought the one from American Dad.
p235
aV@miketripletttp Harper's flag was probably a make up call for taking out WR Bennett with borderline illegal hit. PoS.
p236
aV@ShanePHallam Wasnt Brees 2nd rounder?
p237
aV@skjensen Lance using Brandon Manumaluna  as a victim of owners greed - not best example.
p238
aV@ESPNStatsInfo Orton?
p239
aV@BradBiggs Todd Collins was clearly Martz's guy. Worked well.
p240
aV@WilliamsonNFL How did Carimi look?
p241
aV@skjensen 9 sacks. It's good Jerry is in the solution business. Think how bad it could get if he wasn't.
p242
aV@skjensen I didn't say they can't play. I said they can't play well. Sacks, pressures, whiffs and QB hit #s confirm it.
p243
aV@skjensen Do they have anybody that can play the guard WELL?
p244
aV@evansilva You think Forte's new deal will be closer to Williams or Bradshaw?
p245
aV@ProFootbalFocus What kind of player is Chris Spencer? He is not in top/bottom 15. Avg?
p246
aV@ESPNChiBears Any Oline help on the way?
p247
aV@mikecwright Are they going to get anybody to help oline? Good players seems to be going anywhere but CHI?
p248
aV@ESPNChiBears Chris Williams next?
p249
aV@yourboyroy If there ever was an ESPY for best release Bears would nail it with Manu
p250
aV@ZachZaidman 30th ranked offense was the result.
p251
aV@WilliamsonNFL What can you get for Olsen? 3rd round pick? Cutler needs somebody to throw the ball to.
p252
aV@ESPNChiBears So now Bears are looking for players to fir Martz's 30th ranked offense? And who's to say Martz will even be here next year?
p253
aV@mikecwright Are Angelo and Ruskell asleep? Good UFAs seem to be flying off the shelves.
p254
aV@skjensen Crazy&gt;Boring. Sick and tired of fast forwarding 30 minutes labor updates on NFL TA.

p259
aV@Donny_Moore CHI Patrick Mannelly
p260
aV@ReverendRalph I don't think Ponder is any better. 3rd round project elevated by run at QBs.
p261
aV@PriscoCBS Good luck running around for 2+ hours. The longer they run the worse the game gets. Pks only way to go.
p262
aV@FtblSickness You can surely do worse than Orton, but as soon as a team trades for Orton they will start thinking about upgrade.
p263
aV@FtblSickness If 2 teams he's been on don't consider Orton a starter, he's probably not a starter.
p264
aV@ReverendRalph You should include retweet with your answers. If you don't all I see is your comment but no original post.
p265
aV@FO_DougFarrar Another Mastodon album, another drunken face tattoo on Brent's face.
p266
aV@vxmcclure23 Is there a WR not on the roster that Bears are interested in?
p267
aV@evansilva Bush 2010 YPC  on tuft 4.7, on grass  0.8
p268
aV@evansilva Speed guy like Bush badmouthing artificial turf? He'd be much less effective on grass.
p269
aV@deloureiro Michigan?
p270
aV@PFF_Zerodev Let's say Stafford gets hurt again. Do Lions make plans to draft another QB high next year?
p271

aV@PFF_MikeClay Andy Reid HC and Pitts guy OC
p283
aV@ProFootbalFocus I count Manumaleuna as a 0.2 blocker, lump Webb and Omyale into 1 avg one. 5.75 - 1.2 = 4.55 blockers per play.
p284
aV@ProFootbalFocus That's true if you consider Brandon Manumaleuna as a blocker.
p285
aV@evansilva Word "beast" has been thrown around so much it's lost its meaning.
p286
aV@gregolsen82 u ever seriuosly played QB at any level?
p287
aV@PFF_NateJahnke top 40 redskin. Maybe. Probably not.
p288
aV@gregcosell IMO Brandon Marshall. Produced well in few different systems, QBs. Also: Greg Jennings, S. Holmes, T.O.
p289
aV@PFF_MikeClay why would Bears spend $ on another slot guy when they need outside help?
p290

p291
aV@CollinsworthNBC Richard Dent was voted into HOF this year.
p292
aV@deloureiro What if #18 goes down for the colts? They won't win more than couple of games. Do they take Luck? I would.
p293
aV@AdamSchefter What if thing go horribly wrong for SD, CHI, or DAL and they get #1? Do they take Luck of put it on auction?
p294
aV@deloureiro It would be refreshing for somebody with authority to rip on some guys, instead of just recycling if #12s &gt; #18 &gt;#9.
p295
aV@CollinsworthNBC Lions D: dline & ??? Fairley boom or bust guy. Overall not better than last year.
p296
aV@bcbbc2202 seriously, do 5 qbs that shouldn't be in the NFL.
p297
aV@CollinsworthNBC ye ye ye Brady, Manning and on... do list of worst QBs. Should be good.
p298
aV@PFF_MikeClay Forte.
p299
aV@PFF_MikeClay Knox?
p300
aV1
p301
aV@gregcosell Redraft: 1. Freeman. 2. Sanchez. 3. Stafford? (or 2. Stafford 3. Sanchez.?)
p302
aV@skjensen Braylon Edwards would be the IMO. Size, speed, limited his drops, good attitude, blocks when asked. Jets won't make him $$$ offer.
p303
aV@skjensen All WRs on the market this season have personality/law issues. The ones that don't are just not that good.
p304
aV@ShawnZobel_DHQ How is Rudolph (4.71 40) faster than Olsen (4.51)?
p305
aV@JC_NFL 3.5 yards per carry for Benson in '10, and got worse as season went on. It's time for a boat ride out of cincy.
p306
aV@deloureiro If all DBs, LBs are as incompetent as in Farrar's diagram, J. Jones should be first player in Hall of Fame with no snap in NFL.
p307
aV@FO_DougFarrar "after all" sounds like he's a hall of famer, "after all" he hasn't played a down in the NFL.
p308
aV@PFF_MikeClay Can do worse than TO. Not a long term answer.
p309
aV@PFF_MikeClay I just think they need a guy that will get respect from DBs. Knox, Hester were jammed all day against GB.
p310
aV@PFF_MikeClay Bennett seems to be reliable possession guy. They need somebody opposite Knox.
p311
aV@PFF_MikeClay B. Edwards or MSW make more sense for Bears.
p312
aV@evansilva Woulnd't Rams, Bears or Seahawks make more sense for Smith? Chargers already have established WRs.
p313
aV@ChrisWesseling Why are u putting any stock in a standard draft/FA quote?Every single bust was a great hope once.
p314
aV@ChrisWesseling Atl was doing good job finding pieces in draft, trades & FA. Don't see the dire need for a move like this.
p315
aV@ChrisWesseling Atlanta has yet to win a playoff game with current, good group. Turner needs help. DE is a need.
p316
aV@ChrisWesseling So experts are right half the time. ATL could have signed Holmes and save the picks.
p317
aV@ChrisWesseling Experts drafted David Terrell, Matt Jones, Troy Williamson, all Detroit guys and countless others.
p318
aV@ChrisWesseling Never. One. Player. Away.

p322
aV@ChrisWesseling how come none of 13 teams they beat didn't figure it out?
p323
aV@ChrisWesseling easy to defend? Ryan, White, gonzo, turner? What do bears rams skins seahawks can say?

aV@PFF_Zerodev powell bigger than greene for jets.

aV@PFF_Zerodev ut tweet just flashed on nfln screen.

p327
aV@ChrisWesseling how do u prepare to be surprised?
p328
aV@ShawnZobel_DHQ Isn't Michael Johnson a DE?
p329
aV@mikecwright What's next for the Bears? WR, CB, OG?
p330
aV@mikecwright They reached for him with that reaching thing with rubber clamps.
p331
aV@mikecwright Not the Vikings!
p332
aV@PFF_Zerodev At that rate Redskins will own every pick in the 7th round pick and all undrafted FAs
p333
aV@PFF_Zerodev I thought he would go in the 4th. They have to see something in him.
p334
aV@PFF_Zerodev SD sucks balls at special teams. Probably figures as a major help there.
p335
aV@ShawnZobel_DHQ If Greg Little makes it to 3rd round where Bears pick I can die happy.
p336
aV@mikecwright Maybe Redskins and Ravens can share that pick.
p337
aV@PFF_Zerodev Stafford 0-1 with 0 TD, 1 INT.
p338
aV@PFF_Zerodev Meant to say go ahead AZ take him. Don't like that pick at all.
p339
aV@PFF_Zerodev 4.3 per carry? In college? go ahead take him.
p340
aV@ChrisSteuber Isn't Mallett just Derek Anderson plus baggage?
p341
aV@ZachZaidman Absolutely not. To quote Newsome after the Vikings trade fiasco: trade was not finalized. End of story.
p342
aV@evansilva I think they are right. How is stacking up on DTs of current regime different from Millen's stacking up on WRs?
p343
aV@ShawnZobel_DHQ I think all backup QBs in NFCN are better players and are ready to play than Ponders is. Flynn, Hill and even Hanie.
p344
aV@evansilva Bears have 3 smallish wideouts already: Knox, Hester and Davis. Why next?
p345
aV@skjensen Jernigan is 5'9. Unless they plan to put him on top of Knox to make one big WR don't see that happening.
p346
aV@jasonjwilde I'm saying 1. Bears (value+need), 2. Lions (value), 3. Packers (value) and 4. Vikes (need)
p347
aV@deloureiro Then Chicago passes, lets NE picks first, and THEN Bears pick.
p348
aV@ZachZaidman Pass. Knees are gone.
p349
aV@ShawnZobel_DHQ 4 years from now Lions will have to make the choice. Don't like tying too much $ in 1 position. Still no secondary.
p350
aV@mikecwright Run at QBs means better choice for Bears at 29!
p351
aV@PFF_NateJahnke When they got old.
p352
aV@BradBiggs Jones is #2 WR with Falcons. Overpaid way too much.
p353
aV@deloureiro Don't get it. Don't like it.
p354
aVwhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhat
p355
aV@PFF_MikeClay Betting the farm for 14% of targets?
p356
aV@mikecwright Dont like the move. Cutler was actually cheaper, QB and proven.
p357
aV@ShawnZobel_DHQ Never 1 player away. 48 points at home given up to GB.
p358
aV@EKaberon Bad move, you are never 1 player away from SB.
p359
aV@deloureiro Gave up 48 points at home and they are trading farm for a WR? Good luck.
p360
aV@PFF_NateJahnke That pick I like.
p361
aV@PFF_Khaled Dont see Broncos doing a lot blitzing down 35-3. Still can't stop the run.
p362
aV@ChrisSteuber Still don't know why they took him. Already got Dumervil and now Miller ? 4-3 anyone?
p363
aV@PFF_Khaled I dont see Dumervil holding up in running game to well as a DE. He lighter than many TEs.
p364
aV@PFF_Khaled Still Broncos would have two top pass rushing LBs and use 4-3, makes little sense to me.
p365
aV@DParrPFW D let them down vs Packers. Adding JJ to already good O solves nothing.
p366
aV@JC_NFL amen to that.
p367
aV@deloureiro Bears would have to part ways with picks for Smith. Don't see that happening.
p368
aV@deloureiro Roster full of holes and ? and they consider that move? Seems nuts to me.
p369
aV@ESPNChiBulls That's his picture.
p370
aV@skjensen Are the coaches allowed to talk to them?
p371
aV@ChrisSteuber Pass rushing LB in a 4-3 as a #2 overall? Don't they sill have Dumervil who is too small to be DE?
p372
aV@mikecwright don't know how teams will resist WR with less than 300 yards last year.
p373
aV@ChrisWesseling not saying anything about Marshall, but whatever freeman is saying is either obviuos (like now) or bs predictions.
p374
aV@ChrisWesseling weren't boatload of fins arrested since last offseason? They did nothing.
p375
aV@ChrisWesseling are dolphins gonna cut B Marh? No. Release him? No. Freeman has no idea what he's tweetin about.

aV@FO_BBarnwell Denver used 3-4 last season? Looked like 0-0.
p432
aV@skjensen I think Braylon Edwards would be cheaper than Rice, more durable and overall better choice for Bears to go after.

p444
aV@ChrisSteuber Chris, what do you think about Andy Fantuz, WR Bears signed from CFL. Can he be effective in the NFL?
p445
aV@mikecwright I like what they've got. Bears are #1 WR away from being great receiving group.
p446
aV@mikecwright I think we have. Knox and Hester get shut down when it matters. No match to GB secondary.
p447
aV@mikecwright Im afraid of Bears ignoring WR upgrade in draft counting on FA, lockout-he gets no coaching, back to season with same crew.
p448
aV@mikecwright General statement on 40 time. From what Ive seen on him on the internet - good not great.
p449
aV@mikecwright Jerry Rice ran 4.6 40, Anquan Boldin 4.86, Matt Jones 4.3. There is too much attention paid to that.
p450
aV@mikecwright As in: offseason hero, off in the season.
p451
aV@mikecwright At worst he's 2011 DA )))
p452
aV@mikecwright True, but good to see Bears trying to upgrade at WR. Not much risk in trying him out. No draft pick wasted.
p453
aV@mikecwright He had almost 1400 rec yards. Has to be good at something?

p458

p459
aV@ESPNChiBears Jay was not at the conference and didn't talk much after the game. I think it'd be good to 6 to do answer some questions.
p460
aV@ESPNChiBears Wouldn't it be better for Bears and Jay to do a press conference and address all the issues?
p461
aV@BradBiggs Jay who?
p462
aV@PFF_MikeClay What about most runs?
p463
aV@CBSSportsNFL I'd leave and NEVER come back there.
p464
aV@ChrisSteuber Isn't Mallett just Matt Jones still playing QB? I think Jags won't go there.
p465
aV@ZachZaidman You can play on a stretcher. That doesnt mean you can play well.
p466
aV@ProFootballTalk He lost AFC C game with some lousy throws. QBs needs knees to throw.

aV@EAMaddenNFL "Meh"
p468
aV@FO_BBarnwell Orton always seems to be at the bad end of "better than" sentences.
p469
aV@ChrisSteuber Thx, also don't you think Bears might go WR in 1st round? Oline is shaping up OK so far.
p470
aV@ChrisSteuber Isn't Tyron Smith too light at 280 to be a tackle in the NFL? Last thing Bears need is another redshirt in1st round.
p471
aV@skjensen Aaron Rodgers like.
p472
aV@caplannfl Bears would kill for player like R. White and now him, Turner and oline are not enough? EXCUSES!!!

aV@AfternoonSaloon Why not keep Olsen and send 3rd round pick to AZ for Boldin? Bears have bigger needs than WR but do you trust JA draft skil
p558
aV@bears_insider #1 Antrel Rolle, #2 Kampman, #3 Peppers.
p559
aV@WaddleandSilvy Forget Peppers. Get Kampmann and Antrel Rolle.
p560
aV@AfternoonSaloon AZ's Antrel Rolle is about to be released. How about getting him?
p561
aV@WaddleandSilvy Fan just received fax from Barry. Guess what?
p562
aV@WaddleandSilvy Exactly the same attitude that made Vikes go for it on 4th down against Dallas last week killed them yesterday. Good.
p563
aV@RealDeal91 Hey Tommie was I right with Germany?
p564
aV@RealDeal91 Germany.
p565
aV@RealDeal91 Got to be Temple or Ft Hood, TX
p566
aV@RealDeal91 Kileen TX

aV@skjensen Viking loving Bears writer? Makes me want to make sun times my homepage.
p568
aV@WaddleandSilvy Would they take Angelo too? He's gotta be good at something, right?
p569
aV@tightwork88 Everybody thinks you are pulling a stunt on a friend or sumthing.
p570
aV@BradBiggs Can Bears still pursue him although Packers said no?
p571
aV@ESPNChiBears How are Tillman and Knox doing?
p572
aV@fb_outsiders It should be: Bear AND 'Wale out for the season
p573
aV@PackerNews
p574
aV@richeisen At that rate 60 minutes might actually be just that. 7-3 times 4. Game over.
p575
aV@mortreport You think Bears would take 2nd mortgage on the farm and give Cards 1st rounder in 2011 for Boldin?
p576
aV@ProFootballTalk @RealDeal91
p577
aV@BradBiggs 4.78 40 time for Bell. Is the website correct?
p578
aV@JayCutler6 Good luck.
p579
aV@Adam_Schefter Cutler 11 TDs, 10 INTs, Del Homme 4 TDs, 13 INTs. Not that fair.
p580
aV@JayCutler6 Congrats!
p581
aV@SI_PeterKing Little judgemental on Adams. 2 years is a too short to judge DE
p582
aV@DavidHaugh Ced would never be the player he is now had he stayed in Chi. He needed a solid shake up that only getting cut could give.
p583
aV@ProFootballTalk @ProFootballTalk @Tanuuuu @Tanuuuu  http://tinyurl.com/y943b Deion is to young WRs as Michael Jackson to ???

aV@JayCutler6 Tie=both lose

aV@JayCutler6 @JayCutler6  Tie=both loose

aV@BradBiggs @pastapadre @fb_outsiders @ProFootballTalk  http://www.eamobile.com/i/ Is Forte allright?
p587
aV@BradBiggs You think Bears will keep Brandon Rideau on practice squad?
p588
aV@Waddleandsilvy Bears gave only 17 more points last year. Yards don't win games.
p589
aV@BradBiggs @richeisen @BearReport Guy can move. Look for Pace on next one.
p590
aV@ChicagoBearscom Are those from yesterdays practice?
p591
aV@RealDeal91 I can almost do it. $20?
p592
aV@fb_outsiders Hester: 75/960/6

aV@Adam_Schefter What no Chicago?
