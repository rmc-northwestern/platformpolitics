V@RubinReport Looks like a typically sunny Manchester day : )
p1
aV@PeterKGeoghegan ha, try visiting the USA : )
p2
aV@PeterKGeoghegan I despair, it's so frustrating!
p3
aV@BRRSC Oh the irony : )
p4
aV@GlasgowAlbum No contest.  The second one for sure.
p5
aV@rickygervais FFS, what a shame. Awful.
p6
aV@COLRICHARDKEMP Thanks for your service.  My brother is currently 6 weeks into his 16 week selection to get into the Parachute Regiment.
p7
aV@ianbremmer Primary challenge?
p8
aV@michaeldweiss Any thoughts on this?  Is it true?  https://t.co/YCjVou1TVk
p9
aV@JasonKander Wishing all the best for you and your family.
p10
aV@akmaciver So it's not about freeing Scotland, after all, it's about destroying the UK!
p11
aV@akmaciver Sounds like a purge, strange decision
p12
aV@AnasSarwar So sorry to hear this @AnasSarwar
p13
aV@COLRICHARDKEMP Vanquisher?
p14
aV@PeterKGeoghegan That's a decent time, well done!
p15
aV@PeterKGeoghegan Curious, what type of Brexit would you go for?  Assuming we have to Brexit.
p16
aV@ianbremmer Surprised you didn't blame Brexit!
p17
aV@HCH_Hill @theresa_may Do you think this could make some Remain voters become reluctant Leave voters? Due to the way the EU has treated May.
p18
aV@montie @philipjcowley Fareed missed Brexit and Trump and is far too willing to rely on the usual sources such as H\u2026 https://t.co/OYbIJ9KEd7
p19
aV@AgentP22 I bet the SNP will blame Westminster!
p20
aV@colinbraziersky Looks like you were there with Vladimir Putin!  : )
p21
aV@PerfidiousAlbn Think he could setup a new pro-independence party?
p22
aV@alexmassie Breathtaking!
p23
aV@cascamike @Reuters Who the heck are the 15.5 percent of Dems that don\u2019t?
p24
aV@fred_guttenberg I'm so sorry for your loss.  I will be voting the same way as you and I'm helping with postcards i\u2026 https://t.co/Vz9f2oIEIB
p25
aV@bobmca1 Fantastic
p26
aV@ianbremmer I don't think this is quite accurate for the UK.  There is a minimum of 20 vacation days a year + 8 public holidays.
p27
aV@FraserWhyte81 Oh no.  Nutcases on all sides : (
p28
aV@PeterKGeoghegan Well, you are supremely negative about the UK.  There are some good things that it does, for examp\u2026 https://t.co/p6n5KUVeIZ
p29
aV@movie_goofs @philipjcowley You just shattered my world!
p30
aV@PeterKGeoghegan Have you ever said anything positive about the UK?
p31
aV@oliverdarcy Does this mean all of Infowars are close to being removed?  such a Paul Joseph Watson etc?
p32
aV@EvanstonPD True, but do you really think it's fair to ask cyclists to ride on Chicago Ave?  It's a death-trap.
p33
aV@BrexitCentral @DominicRaab @MichelBarnier Barnier reminds me of what Sepp Blatter used to give press conferences.
p34
aV@akmaciver No, not all!!!! Please don't think that!
p35
aV@NGrossman81 @RonBrownstein Incorrect, what about Yugoslavia?
p36
aV@YoungScotsUnion So true, has he never seen Patel, Javid, Cleverly?
p37
aV@NileGardiner You should have spoken out much much earlier @NileGardiner
p38
aV@nycjayjay Oh the humanity!
p39
aV@FOXSoccer Can you guys please give it a rest with the sponsorship stuff?  Really, Verizon hasn't brought us the wo\u2026 https://t.co/axVEd5ek7y
p40
aV@TedDeutch Fair play, but have you seen the Croatia team?
p41
aV@ianbremmer Oh give it a rest Ian, this has nothing to do with Brexit.
p42
aV@HarryMaguire93 So proud of all of you!  Thanks for the wonderful ride!
p43
aV@JoeNBC Tusk is also unelected
p44
aVRT @rahulsetia007: I hope everyone takes a moment today to remember Saman Gunan, the Thai Navy Seal that died making sure the kids stuck in\u2026
p45
aV@colinbraziersky @MorrisseyHelena I am so terribly sorry Colin.  We're praying for you.
p46
aV@barneyronay That almost sounds like a compliment about something English, @barneyronay
p47
aV@barneyronay and then you would have celebrated as you would have said it was a punishment for Brexit.  Don't kid yourself Barney.
p48
aVRT @AgentP22: The SNP react to England's excellent world cup victory over Columbia... https://t.co/9n5hLogfsK
p49
aV@KateAndrs @PerfidiousAlbn Please don't give up the fight Kate, the NHS is in desperate need of fresh ideas, keep em coming!  : )
p50
aVRT @JuliaHB1: Yet my binmen can\u2019t manage to walk one yard up my front path to collect the bins. Sigh. https://t.co/KnTTrfVY9v
p51
aV@barneyronay Must be the fault of Brexit, eh?
p52
aV@shannonrwatts It would be wonderful to get more women in office, maybe then we could have some sane policies such\u2026 https://t.co/zWojHqt2oG
p53
aV@FraserWhyte81 Gosh, get well soon.  Best wishes!
p54
aV@double_dex @CSG1973 @KateAndrs Interesting, more life saving alternatives : )
p55
aV@NileGardiner You could help kill it in America too if you actually gave rights to people, such as healthcare, vacation time etc
p56
aV@lass_ayrshire Yep! Lived here for 13 years!  Be sure to visit Millennium Park, you're really close!
p57
aV@double_dex @CSG1973 @KateAndrs Kate has been saying that the US system is not the way to go.  Mainland Europe has\u2026 https://t.co/fI2ZoWjCmf
p58
aV@montie Respect that you are excited @montie but this is going to be really bad for regular folks.  We don't get va\u2026 https://t.co/h20einA813
p59
aV@KateAndrs We should listen to anyone that can help the NHS, not take offense
p60
aV@holland_tom Now that's a proper British suntan!
p61
aV@barneyronay Right on cue, Ronay finds something negative to say about England, must be Brexit that did it!
p62
aV@barneyronay You could have made a compliment about something British Barney, but no.
p63
aV@charlescwcooke I didn't know you still cared about Britain!  I hope you can write about Brexit a bit more : )
p64
aV@charlescwcooke Did they actually separate kids from their parent/guardian under Obama though?  Evidence?
p65
aV@MichaelSkolnik Wow, that's powerful
p66
aV@FraserWhyte81 It stinks from all angles : (
p67
aV@darrengrimes_ May well be true @darrengrimes_ but perhaps this was a bad week to do it, with kids being separated\u2026 https://t.co/gmf9QidVQx
p68
aV@yuilly12 @nickeardleybbc Westminster could have offered a deal that cured all diseases and the SNP would take issue with it.
p69
aV@alexmassie Please no!
p70
aV@SpeakerRyan Yeah, how about some paternity and maternity leave for people to look after their kids.
p71
aV@KirstenPowers @USATODAY @usatopinion Well done!  Can't help wondering if long hours, little vacation time and anxi\u2026 https://t.co/rIfQPR3V3J
p72
aV@lsh88uk Any data on the SNP?
p73
aV@seagulls72 @marinamaral2 Thankful for his service!
p74
aV@darrengrimes_ @sajidjavid Bravo!
p75
aV@lass_ayrshire You look great in both, but bravo nonetheless!
p76
aV@SkyNews It would be funny if she ended up rejecting both of them : )
p77
aV@darrengrimes_ I saw him on MSNBC this morning while at the gym : )
p78
aV@RickSpur @MailSport Selling Wanyama would be a mistake
p79
aV@Education4Libs What about the Bush's?
p80
aV@DGreenbaum @MaxBoot Heartfelt condolences, a beautiful piece.  As an immigrant myself, I can certainly relate to this.
p81
aV@HCH_Hill @CityMetric @JonnElledge A very good, thoughtful debate, thanks for sharing!
p82
aV@SkyNews He only got 6 months?
p83
aV@fred_guttenberg I'm so terribly sorry for your loss.
p84
aV@Nigel_Farage and you're a pawn of Russia!  Syria's friend, no surprise you're against this.
p85
aVRT @ianbremmer: Someone should form a support group. https://t.co/vufsM3E1uB
p86
aVRT @MarkHertling: Be more than you appear to be. Speak less, act more, and always put the welfare of the team above your own.
p87
aV@realDonaldTrump You really are a very unstable person.
p88
aV@COLRICHARDKEMP Do you have any thoughts on how we should deal with the increase in murders in London?  Thank you
p89
aV@WyeLea @Telegraph There should be more anger about the knife crime : (
p90
aV@malcolmcameron7 Just sent a follow request.  Have no fear, I'm a friend, not a foe : )
p91
aV@TheTotallyShow Vialli!
p92
aV@Outlook @Joseantoe I am unable to login to https://t.co/iS9l4AMjqc, I'm in Chicago, USA, when will it be available?
p93
aV@e_spurs haha, and both Ali goals : )
p94
aV@afneil and Khan keeps complaining about Brexit.  He should be focusing on crime!
p95
aV@COLRICHARDKEMP God bless.  RIP.
p96
aV@marinamaral2 Have you done Jan Smuts? Thanks!
p97
aV@anneapplebaum @MarkGaleotti Have you ever actually complimented Britain, Anne?
p98
aV@NickCohen4 @LLHalf That's a great time, well done!
p99
aV@shannonrwatts @MomsDemand It's so frustrating to see this.  It was an honor to be at the Chicago March tomorrow th\u2026 https://t.co/wn7HOjHSK9
p100
aV@atzuniga @shannonrwatts haha, brilliant!
p101
aV@krassenstein @SallyQYates I'll be at the march in Chicago!
p102
aV@Mrs_Cr7 If you read the article, they talk about the fact that blacks are ignored.  But they are working to save t\u2026 https://t.co/yOMynmg4EY
p103
aV@BRRSC Do you mean this one?  https://t.co/tA2u9lkRJl
p104
aV@renato_mariotti Thank you for trying!
p105
aV@BRRSC This is wrong.  There are NO strong gun law in the US.  I know, I live in Chicago.
p106
aV@RyanAFournier @BRRSC No, they don't, no city in America has strict gun control.
