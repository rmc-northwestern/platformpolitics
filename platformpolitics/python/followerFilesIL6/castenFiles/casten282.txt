aVRT @arielleishammin: @FunnyMeNow lol
p3053
aVI just see a lot of YTers that are eager to succeed and end up getting used. That's not to say there aren't good deals out there tho!
p3054
aVRT @BriaandChrissy: @FunnyMeNow You're spot on!
p3055
aVAs a youtuber, it's important to understand that most of the business deals randomly offered to you are not in your best interest.
p3056
aV@DevonRealDeal Im mean you can't just mistreat employees in hopes that it makes them go to college. that just seems crazy.
p3057
aV@DevonRealDeal the bottom line is, no one should get paid less than their time is actually worth.
p3058
aV@DevonRealDeal $15 dollars an hour is shit pay. try budgeting out everything you'd need to survive, everything on $15x 40hrs.
p3059
aV@DevonRealDeal Personally that wouldn't effect my decision. Furthermore, there is no evidence suggesting anyone else would either.
p3060
aV@DevonRealDeal One cant live off those wages. You'll see what I mean when you pay all your own bills and live on your own.
p3061
aV@DevonRealDeal if the company can't treat it's employee's right and stay in business, it's a sweatshop and should fail.
p3062
aV@DevonRealDeal Its not crazy for them to ask for a raise. The company can afford it. Minimum wage jobs are often the most difficult.
p3063
aVJust did 100% my Christmas shopping. I bought everything online this year ;)
