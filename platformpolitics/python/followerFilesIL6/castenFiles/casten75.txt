aV@kidrico2002 If Bonds, McGwire, Sosa, and others have themselves and each other their PED shots on the field, then I would agree.
p246
aV@kidrico2002 yes he would be an HOFer because he was a good pitcher. But it's a false equivalency to compare spitballs with steroids.
p247
aV@kidrico2002 not when it's done in full view of four umpires and 50,000 fans. No, it doesn't compare at all to BALCO.
p248
aV@kidrico2002 @buster_espn PEDs are different than amphetamines. Don't you think?
p249
aV@kidrico2002 do you think the hidden ball trick is cheating? I don't, and neither do I think throwing a spitter is cheating.
p250
aV@kidrico2002 honest to god, comparing spitballera to steroid takers is a true sign of cowardice.
p251
aV@Buster_ESPN lots of guys took amphetamines. We know that. That didn't help them hit home runs. Just take the field.
p252
aVMaybe just look at their stats. Hmm, 72 home runs , gee, wonder what happened.  The cream and the clear ..  gee, wonder what that was about.
p253
aV@Buster_ESPN you can't figure out who the cheaters are? Great reporting.
